A common love for each other
A common gift to the Saviour
A common bond holding us to the Lord
A common strength when we are weary
A common hope for tomorrow
A common joy in the truth of God's word
[1]
In his family we can meet each other's needs
We can light each one's path
We can bear each one's grief
As his children, we can comfort each care
We can build each one's faith
We can work, we can share
[2]
In his family, all the love that we show
All the help that we give
All the life we bestow
As his children, they're an offering we make
Not expecting return, 
Just a gift for his sake</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
A life of overcoming, 
a life of ceaseless praise,  
be this thy blessed portion,  
throughout the coming days.
The victory was purchased
on Calv’ry’s cross for thee,
sin shall not have dominion,
the Son hath made thee free.
[2]
And would’st thou know the secret
of constant victory?
Let in the Overcomer,
and He will conquer thee!
Thy broken spirit, taken 
in sweet captivity,
shall glory in His triumph
and share His victory.
[3]
Then from thy life ascending
one triumph note of praise,
(for they who always conquer
a victor’s song must raise,)
shall echo on unceasing
till Satan’s host doth flee
before our glorious watchword,
“Lord, victory for me.”
[4]
Though all the path before thee
the host of darkness fill, 
 look to thy Father’s promise,
and claim the victory still.
Faith sees the heavenly legions,
where doubt sees nought but foes,
and through the very conflict
 her life the stronger grows.
[5]
More stern will grow the conflict
 as nears our King’s return,
and they alone can face it
who this great lesson learn:
that from them God asks nothing
but to unlatch the door
admitting Him, who through them
will conquer evermore.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing;
our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great,
and, armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not His equal.
[2]
With force of arms we nothing can,
full soon were we down ridden;
but for us fights the proper Man
whom God Himself has bidden.
Ask ye: Who is this same?
Christ Jesus is His name,
the Lord Sabaoth’s Son;
He, and no other one,
shall conquer in the battle.
[3]
And were this world all devils o’er,
and watching to devour us,
we lay it not to heart so sore;
not they can overpower us.
And let the prince of ill
look grim as e’er he will,
he harms us not a whit;
for why? His doom is writ;
a word shall quickly slay him.
[4]
God’s word, for all their craft and force,
one moment will not linger,
but, spite of hell, shall have its course;
‘tis written by His finger.
And though they take our life,
goods, honour, children, wife,
yet is their profit small;
these things shall vanish all,
the city of God remaineth.</Contents>

A ruler once came to Jesus by night,
to ask Him the way of salvation and light;
the Master made answer in words true and plain:
“Ye must be born again!” 
[chorus]
“Ye must be born again!” 
“Ye must be born again!”.
I verily, verily, say unto you, 
“Ye must be born again!” 
[2]
Ye children of men, attend to the word
so solemnly uttered by Jesus, the Lord;
and let not this message to you be in vain, 
“Ye must be born again!” 
[3]
O ye who would enter that glorious rest
and sing with the ransomed the song of the blest,
the life everlasting if ye would obtain,
“Ye must be born again!” 
[4]
A dear one in heaven thy heart yearns to see,
at the beautiful gates may be watching for thee;
then list to the note of this solemn refrain:
“Ye must be born again!” </Contents>

A safe stronghold our God is still,
A trusty shield and weapon;
He'll help us clear from all the ill
That hath us now o'ertaken.
The ancient prince of hell
Hath risen with purpose fell;
Strong mail of craft and power
He weareth in this hour;
On earth is not His fellow.
[2]
With force of arms we nothing can,
Full soon were we down-ridden;
But for us fights the proper Man,
Whom God Himself hath bidden.

And were this world all devils o'er,
And watching to devour us,
We lay it not to heart so sore;

Look grim as e'er he will,

For why? his doom is writ;
A word shall quickly slay him.

But, spite of hell, shall have its course;

A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord,
a wonderful Saviour to me:
he hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
where rivers of pleasure I see.
[chorus]
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
that shadows a dry, thirsty land;
he hideth my life in the depths of his love,
and covers me there with his hand,
and covers me there with his hand.
[2]
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord,
he taketh my burden away;
he holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
he giveth me strength as my day.
[3]
With numberless blessings each moment he crowns,
and, filled with his goodness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God
for such a Redeemer as mine!
[4]
When clothed in his brightness transported I rise
to meet him in clouds of the sky,
his perfect salvation, his wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high.</Contents>

Abide with me, fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
[2]
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
[3]
I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.
[4]
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
[5]
Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies,
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</Contents>

I’m resting in the Crucified!
[chorus]
Abiding, abiding, oh! so 
wondrous sweet!
I’m resting, resting at the
Saviour’s feet.

He speaks, and by His word is given
His peace, a rich foretaste of heaven!
Not as the world He peace doth give;
‘tis through this hope my soul shall live.
[3]
I live; not I; ‘tis He alone
by whom the mighty work is done;
dead to myself, alive to Him,
I count all loss His rest to gain.
[4]
Now rest, my heart, the work is done,
I’m saved through the Eternal Son!
Let all my powers my soul employ,
To tell the world my peace and joy.</Contents>

Above the hills of time the Cross is gleaming;
Fair as the sun when night has turned to day;
And from it love's pure light is richly streaming
To cleanse the heart and banish sin away.

To this dear Cross the eyes of men are turning
Today as in the ages lost to sight;
And so for Thee O Christ, men's hearts are yearning
As ship-wrecked seamen yearn for morning light.
[2]
The Cross, O Christ, Thy wondrous love revealing,
Awakes our hearts as with the light of morn;
And pardon o'er our sinful spirits stealing
Tells us that we, in Thee, have been reborn.

Like echoes to sweet temple bells replying,
Our hearts, O Lord make answer to Thy love;
And we will love Thee with a love undying,
Till we are gathered to Thy home above.</Contents>

Above thine own ambitions here,
another voice is sounding clear;
it is the call of God to thee,
“Oh, leave thine all and follow Me.”
[chorus]
Go through with God, thy vows to pay,
thy life upon the altar lay;
the Holy Ghost will do the rest,
and bring to thee God's very best!
[2]
The call of God, it is so clear,
but friendships call, and home is dear;
ah, lonely was the path He trod;
then wilt thou not go through with God?
[3]
So soon Eternal Morn shall dawn,
how fast the night is hastening on;
so soon His lovely face to see,
how sad to empty handed be!
[4]
The price is high, severe the test,
for those who would enjoy God's best;
surrender all, then take the road,
with those who will go through with
God.</Contents>

Behold, Thou in the inward parts

within the hidden part.

Let my hands perform His bidding,
let my feet run in His ways,
let mine eyes see Jesus only,
let my lips speak forth His praise.
[3]
Since my eyes were fixed on Jesus,
I've lost sight of all beside;
so enchained my spirit's vision,
looking at the Crucified.
[4]
Oh, what wonder! how amazing!
Jesus, glorious King of kings,
deigns to call me His beloved,
lets me rest beneath His wings.</Contents>

All glory, laud and honour
To Thee, Redeemer, King,
To whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring.
Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David's royal Son,
Who in the Lord's name comest,
The King and blessèd One.
[2]
The company of angels
Are praising Thee on high,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply.
The people of the Hebrews
With psalms before Thee went;
Our praise and prayer and anthems
Before Thee we present.
[3]
To Thee before Thy passion
They sang their hymns of praise;
To Thee now high exalted
Our melody we raise.
Thou didst accept their praises;
Accept the prayers we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.
[4]
All glory, laud and honour
To Thee, Redeemer, King,
To whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring.</Contents>

All hail the power of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God,
Who from His altar call;
Extol Him in whose path ye trod,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye seed of Israel's chosen race,
Ye ransomed of the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.
[4]
Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
The wormwood and the gall,
Go, spread your trophies at His feet,
And crown Him Lord of all.
[5]
Let every kindred, every tribe
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.
[6]
O that, with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall,
Join in the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all!</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
All my hope on God is founded;
he doth still my trust renew,
me through change and chance he guideth,
only good and only true.
God unknown, he alone
calls my heart to be his own.
[2]
Pride of man and earthly glory,
sword and crown betray his trust;
what with care and toil he buildeth,
tower and temple, fall to dust.
But God's pow'r, hour by hour,
is my temple and my tower.
[3]
God's great goodness aye endureth,
deep his wisdom, passing thought:
splendour, life, and light attend him,
beauty springeth out of naught.
Evermore from his store
new-born worlds rise and adore.
[4]
Daily doth th'almighty giver
bounteous gifts on us bestow;
his desire our soul delighteth,
pleasure leads us where we go.
Love doth stand at his hand;
joy doth wait on his command.
[5]
Still from man to God eternal
sacrifice of praise be done,
high above all praises praising
for the gift of Christ his Son.
Christ doth call one and all:
ye who follow shall not fall.</Contents>

All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
Him serve with mirth, His praise forthtell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
[2]
Know that the Lord is God indeed,
Without our aid He did us make:
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
[3]
O enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto:
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
[4]
For why, the Lord our God is good;
His mercy is forever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
[5]
Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him all creatures here below,
Praise Him above, ye heavenly hosts;
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</Contents>

All the way my saviour leads me,
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who through life has been my guide?
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell,
For I know whate'er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well.
[2]
All the way my Saviour leads me,
Cheers each winding path I tread.
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the Living Bread.
Though my weary steps may falter
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from a Rock before me,
Lo! a spring of joy I see.
[3]
And all the way my Saviour leads me,
Oh, the fullness of His love.
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father's house above.
And when my spirit clothed immortal
Wings its flight to realms of day,
This my song through endless ages,
Jesus led me all the way.</Contents>

All things are possible to him
that can in Jesus’ name believe;
Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,
Thy truth I lovingly receive.
I can, I do believe in Thee;
all things are possible to me.
[2]
‘Twas most impossible of all
that here sin’s reign in me should cease,
yet shall it be, I know it shall;
Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness!
If nothing is too hard for Thee,
all things are possible to me.
[3]
Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,
the Word of God shall never fail;
the Lord can break sin’s iron sway;
‘tis certain, though impossible.
The thing impossible shall be.
All things are possible to me.
[4]
All things are possible to God;
to Christ, the power of God in man;
to me, when I am all renewed,
in Christ am fully formed again,
and from the reign of sin set free,
all things are possible to me.
[5]
All things are possible to God;
to Christ, the power of God in me;
now shed Thy mighty Self abroad,
let me no longer live, but Thee;
give me this hour in Thee to prove
the sweet omnipotence of love.</Contents>

All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.
[1]
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.
[2]
The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset, and the morning
That brightens up the sky.
[3]
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.
[4]
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.</Contents>

For what you have done
His blood must atone:         
the Father hath stricken for you His dear Son.
The Lord, in the day
of his anger, did lay        
your sins on the Lamb, and He bore them away.

He answered for all:
O come at His call,          
and low at His cross with astonishment fall!
But lift up your eyes
at Jesus’ cries:                       
impassive, He suffers; immortal, He dies.

my Advocate see,

My ransom He was
when He bled on the cross;

“Go, Spirit, go Thy way:
some more convenient day
on Thee I’ll call.”

“Almost persuaded”: come, come today!
“Almost persuaded”: turn not away!
Jesus invites you here,
angels are lingering near,
prayers rise from hearts so dear,
O wanderer, come!

“Almost persuaded”: harvest is past!
“Almost persuaded”: doom comes at

“Almost” can not avail;
“Almost” is but to fail,

“Almost” - but lost!</Contents>

Am I a soldier of the cross
a follower of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause
or blush to speak His name?
[chorus]
In the name, the precious name
of Him who died for me,
through grace I’ll win the promised crown,
whate’er my cross may be.
[2]
Must I be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease,
while others fought to win the prize,
and sailed through bloody seas?
[3]
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
to help me on to God?
[4]
Since I must fight if I would reign,
increase my courage, Lord!
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain
supported by Thy word.</Contents>

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
[2]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!
[3]
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
[4]
The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.
[5]
Yes, when this heart and flesh shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace.
[6]
When we've been there a thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.</Contents>

And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Saviour's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
[2]
'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies:
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the first-born seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine!
'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.
[3]
He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race.
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.
[4]
Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
[5]
No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.</Contents>

And I thank you Lord
For the trials that come my way
In that way I can grow each day
As I let you lead
And I thank you Lord
For the patience those trials bring
In that process of growing
I can learn to care
[chorus]
But it goes against the way I am
To put my human nature down
And let the spirit
Take control of all I do
Cause when those trials come
My human nature shouts the things to do
And God's soft prompting
Can be easily ignored
[2]
Yes I thank you Lord
For the vic-t'ry those trials bring
In surrender of ev'rything
Life is still worthwhile
And I thank you Lord
That when ev'rything's put in place
In that way I can see your face
And it's there you belong</Contents>

Angel voices ever singing
Round Thy throne of light,
Angel harps forever ringing,
Rest not day nor night;
Thousands only live to bless Thee,
And confess Thee
Lord of might.
[2]
Thou who art beyond the farthest
Mortal eye can scan,
Can it be that Thou regardest
Songs of sinful man?
Can we know that Thou art near us
And wilt hear us?
Yes, we can.
[3]
Yes, we know that Thou rejoicest
O'er each work of Thine;
Thou didst ears and hands and voices
For Thy praise design;
Craftsman's art and music's measure
For Thy pleasure
All combine.
[4]
In Thy house, great God, we offer
Of Thine own to Thee,
And for Thine acceptance proffer,
All unworthily,
Hearts and minds and hands and voices
In our choicest
Psalmody.
[5]
Honour, glory, might, and merit
Thine shall ever be,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Blessèd Trinity.
Of the best that Thou hast given
Earth and heaven
Render Thee.</Contents>

Angels, from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
[chorus]
Come and worship
Christ, the new-born King.
Come and worship
Worship Christ, the new-born King.
[2]
Shepherds, in the field abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant-light:
[3]
Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great desire of nations,
Ye have seen His natal star:
[4]
Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord descending
In His temple shall appear:</Contents>

Anywhere! anywhere! fear I cannot know,

Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,

Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways,
anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
when the darkling shadows round about me creep.
Knowing I shall waken never more to roam.
anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.</Contents>

Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat,
where Jesus answers prayer;
there humbly fall before His feet,
for none can perish there.

Thy promise is my only plea;
with this I venture nigh;
Thou callest burdened souls to Thee,
and such, O Lord, am I.

Bowed down beneath a load of sin,
by Satan sorely pressed,
by wars without, and fears within,
I come to Thee for rest.
[4]
Be Thou my shield and hiding-place,
that, sheltered near Thy side,
I may my fierce accuser face,
and tell Him Thou hast died.

Oh, wondrous love! to bleed and die,
to bear the Cross and shame,
that guilty sinners, such as I,
might plead Thy gracious Name.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Are you now in depths of sorrow,
where no arm can reach so low?
There is One whose arms almighty
reach beyond your deepest woe.
God the Eternal is your refuge.
Let it still your wild alarms;
underneath your deepest sorrow
are the everlasting arms.
[2]
Other arms grow faint and weary,
these can never faint nor fail:
others reach our mounts of blessing,
these our lowest, loneliest vale.
Oh, that all might know His friendship!
Oh, that all might see His charms!
Oh, that all might have beneath them
Jesus’ everlasting arms!
[3]
Underneath us, oh, how easy!
We have not to mount on high,
but to sink into His fullness,
and in trustful weakness lie.
And we find our humbling failures
save us from the strength that harms,
we may fail, but underneath us
are the everlasting arms.
[4]
Arms of Jesus! fold me closer
to Thy strong and loving breast,
till my spirit on Thy bosom
finds its everlasting rest;
and when time’s last sands are sinking,
shield my heart from all alarms,
softly whispering, “Underneath you
are the everlasting arms.”</Contents>

Arise, my soul, arise,
shake off thy guilty fears,
the bleeding Sacrifice
in my behalf appears;
before the throne my Surety stands,
my name is written on His Hands.
[2]
He ever lives above,
for me to intercede,
His all redeeming love,
His precious blood to plead;
His blood atoned for all our race,
and sprinkles now the throne of grace.
[3]
Five bleeding wounds He bears,
received on Calvary:
they pour effectual prayers,
they strongly speak for me.
“Forgive him, oh, forgive,” they cry,
“Nor let the ransomed sinner die.”
[4]
My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
with confidence I now draw nigh,
and “Father, Abba Father!” cry.</Contents>

Why slumbers in its sheath Thy sword?
O rouse Thee, for Thine honour’s sake;

Behold, what numbers still withstand
Thy sovereign rule and just command,
reject Thy grace, Thy threats despise,
and hurl defiance at the skies.

Haste then, but come not to destroy;
mercy is Thine, Thy crown, Thy joy:
their hatred quell, their pride remove,
but melt with grace, subdue with love.

Why dost Thou from the conquest  stay?
Why do Thy chariot wheels delay?
Lift up Thyself, hell’s kingdom shake;
arm of the Lord, awake, awake!</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
As little children, 
we would dream of Christmas morn 
And all the gifts and toys 
we knew we'd find 
But we never realized 
a baby born one blessed night 
Gave us the greatest 
gift of our lives 
[chorus]
We were the reason that 
He gave His life 
We were the reason that 
He suffered and died 
To a world that was lost 
He gave all He could give 
To show us the reason to live
[2]
As the years went by, 
we learnt more about gifts 
The giving of ourselves 
and what that means 
On a dark and cloudy day 
a man hung crying in the rain 
Because of love, 
because of love 
[3]
I've finally found the 
reason for living 
It's in giving every part 
of my heart to Him 
In all that I do, 
every word that I say 
I'll be giving my all just for Him, 
just for Him </Contents>

As with gladness men of old
Did the guiding star behold;
As with joy they hailed its light,
Leading onward, beaming bright,
So, most gracious God, may we
Evermore be led by Thee.
[2]
As with joyful steps they sped,
Saviour, to Thy lowly bed,
There to bend the knee before
Thee whom heaven and earth adore,
So may we with willing feet
Ever seek Thy mercy-seat.
[3]
As they offered gifts most rare
At Thy cradle rude and bare,
So may we with holy joy,
Pure, and free from sin's alloy,
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.
[4]
Holy Jesus, every day
Keep us in the narrow way;
And, when earthly things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
[5]
In the heavenly country bright
Need they no created light;
Thou its light, its joy, its crown,
Thou its sun, which goes not down.
There forever may we sing
Hallelujahs to our King.</Contents>

At my worst You found me
At my worst You died
As my worst You loved me
At my worst You tried to tell me
That the best thing I could do
Would be to give my life to You
At my worst You loved me
And now I love You too
[2]
How could You love me Jesus?
How did You know my name?
Why did You save me Jesus?
Oh I'll never know
Why You loved me so
And I'll never see
What You saw in me</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
At the name of Jesus
every knee shall bow,
every tongue confess Him
King of glory now.
‘Tis the Father’s pleasure
we should call Him Lord,
who from the beginning
was the mighty Word.
[2]
Mighty and mysterious
in the highest height,
God from everlasting,
very Light of light.
In the Father’s bosom,
with the Spirits blest,
love, in love eternal,
rest, in perfect rest.
[3]
Humbled for a season,
to receive a name
from the lips of sinners
unto whom He came;
faithfully He bore it
spotless to the last,
brought it back victorious,
when from death He passed.
[4]
Bore it up triumphant
with its human light,
through all ranks of creatures,
to the central height;
to the throne of Godhead,
to the Father’s breast,
filled it with the glory
of that perfect rest.
[5]
In your hearts enthrone Him;
there let Him subdue
all that is not holy,
all that is not true;
crown Him as your Captain
in temptation’s hour,
let His will enfold you
in its light and power.
[6]
Brothers, this Lord Jesus
shall return again,
with His Father’s glory,
with His angel-train;
for all wreaths of empire
meet upon His brow,
and our hearts confess Him
King of glory now.</Contents>

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay;
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
[2]
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes:
I love You, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.
[3]
Be near me, Lord Jesus: I ask You to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children in Your tender care,
And fit us for heaven to live with You there.</Contents>

The truth that sets me free
According to your Word O Lord
Be it unto me

You promised us joy like a river
And Lord we receive it from You
These things You have spoken
You're bringing to pass
This world's disappearing
But Your Word will last

Lord we receive them from You
You will be our provider
In Your word it's revealed
And by the stripes that You bore
We have been healed</Contents>

Be known to us in breaking bread,
But do not then depart;
Saviour, abide with us, and spread
Thy table in our heart.

There sup with us in love divine;
Thy body and Thy blood,
That living bread, that heavenly wine,
Be our immortal food.

We would not live by bread alone,
But by Thy word of grace,
In strength of which we travel on
To our abiding place.</Contents>

Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul: your God will undertake
To guide the future, as He has the past.
Your hope, your confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds shall know
His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord.
When disappointment, grief and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last</Contents>

Beauty for ashes, life evermore,
peace beyond measure;
Jesus won it all.
Saved out of darkness, cleansed by his blood,

He has won it, my salvation,

He is healing, he's redemption
for whoever would come he has won,
that's the cross.

All can take freely water of life;
let all who thirst,

He has won it, my salvation,

He is healing, he's redemption

for in him is the life that destroyed sin and death
and he broke ev'ry chain for the bound and oppressed.
For in him is the life that destroyed sin and death

    <SongNumber>100</SongNumber>
    <Contents>[1]
Before the throne of God above,
I have a strong, a perfect plea,
A great High Priest whose name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me.
My name is graven on His hands,
My name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart,
No tongue can bid me thence depart.
[2]
When Satan tempts me to despair,
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin.
Because the sinless Saviour died,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me,
To look on Him and pardon me.
[3]
Behold Him there! The risen Lamb,
My perfect, spotless righteousness;
The great unchangeable I AM,
The King of glory and of grace!
One with Himself I cannot die,
My soul is purchased with His blood;
My life is hid with Christ on high,
With Christ, my Saviour and my God,
With Christ my Saviour and my God.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Before Your holiness I bow,
oh Jesus come and cleanse me now,
oh come and take away my sin,
and purify me deep within.
I grieve, I grieve, this dreadful state
the evil hid within, I hate,
the good I would, but cannot do,
I’m left the evil to pursue.
[2]
Defiled my very thoughts and mind,
within repulsive sin I find.
How sinful sickness dissipates,
and filthiness makes desolate!
Oh where is there escape for me?
Where can I find His purity?
Oh come Lord Jesus, set me free,
And by Your Blood deliver me!
[3]
Your Word is surely ever true,
and what You promise You will do,
so when You claim to purify
this must be true; God cannot lie.
I come then, Jesus, and I stake
my all upon the Word I take.
It is enough! God’s Word to me
will hold throughout eternity.
[4]
I claim in faith; the prayer prevails,
and as I trust the Blood avails.
Sin’s power is broken, and I know
my heart is cleansed as white as snow.
The Spirit speaks the Word to me
which gives me glorious liberty.
And all my heart is Yours to fill,
to live for ever in Your will.</Contents>

    <SongNumber>100</SongNumber>
    <Contents>[1]
Behold! the mountain of the Lord
in latter days shall rise
on mountain tops above the hills,
and draw the wondering eyes.
[2]
To this the joyful nations round,
all tribes and tongues, shall flow;
up to the hill of God, they’ll say,
and to His house we’ll go.
[3]
The beam that shines from Zion hill
shall lighten every land;
the King who reigns in Salem’s towers
shall all the world command.
[4]
Among the nations He shall judge;
His judgements truth shall guide;
His sceptre shall protect the just,
and quell the sinner’s pride.
[5]
No strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds
disturb those peaceful years;
to ploughshares men shall beat their swords,
to pruning-hooks their spears.
[6]
No longer hosts encountering hosts
shall crowds of slain deplore:
they hang the trumpet in the hall,
and study war no more.
[7]
Come then, O house of Jacob! come
to worship at His shrine;
and, walking in the light of God,
with holy beauties shine.</Contents>

Behold the servant of the Lord:
I wait Thy guiding eye to feel,
To hear and keep Thy every word,
To prove and do Thy perfect will;
Joyful from my own works to cease,
Glad to fulfil all righteousness.
[2]
Me if Thy grace vouchsafe to use,
Meanest of all Thy creatures, me.
The deed, the time, the manner choose:
Let all my fruit be found of Thee.
Let all my works in Thee be wrought,
By Thee to full perfection brought.
[3]
My every weak though good design
O'errule or change, as seems Thee meet:
Jesus, let all my work be Thine -
Thy work, O Lord, is all complete,
And pleasing in Thy Father's sight;
Thou only hast done all things right.
[4]
Here then to Thee Thine own I leave;
Mould as Thou wilt Thy passive clay;
But let me all Thy stamp receive,
But let me all Thy words obey,
Serve with a single heart and eye,
And in Thy glory live and die.</Contents>

    <Title2 />
    <Folder>English</Folder>
    <SongNumber>100</SongNumber>
    <Contents>[1]
Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
And the burden of the day.
[2]
O safe and happy shelter!
O refuge tried and sweet!
O trysting place where heaven's love
And heaven's justice meet!
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream was given,
So seems my Saviour's cross to me
A ladder up to heaven.
[3]
There lies, beneath its shadow,
But on the farther side,
The darkness of an awful grave
That gapes both deep and wide;
And there between us stands the cross,
Two arms outstretched to save;
Like a watchman set to guard the way
From that eternal grave.
[4]
Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart, with tears,
Two wonders I confess-
The wonders of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.
[5]
I take, O cross, thy shadow,
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss-
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.</Contents>

Beneath the glorious throne above,
the crystal fountain springing, -
a river full of life and love, -
is joy and gladness bringing.
[chorus]
O fount of cleansing! flowing free,
that fount is open wide to me,
to me, to me, ‘tis open wide to me.
[2]
Through all my soul its waters flow,
through all my nature stealing;
and deep within my heart I know
the consciousness of healing.
[3]
The barren wastes are fruitful lands,
the desert blooms with roses;
and He, the glory of all lands,
His lovely face discloses.
[4]
My sun no more goes down by day,
my moon no more is waning;
my feet run swift the shining way,
the heavenly portals gaining.</Contents>

Blessèd assurance, Jesus is mine:

Heir of salvation, purchase of God;
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long.
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture burst on my sight;
Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Saviour am happy and blessed;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</Contents>

Blessed be the Fountain of blood,
to a world of sinners revealed:
blessed be the dear Son of God;
only by His stripes are we healed.
Though I’ve wandered far from His 
fold,
bringing to my heart pain and woe,
wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
and I shall be whiter than snow.
[chorus]
Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow,
wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
and I shall be whiter than snow.
[2]
Thorny was the crown that He wore,
and the cross His body o’ercame;
grievous were the sorrows He bore,
but He suffered thus not in vain.
May I to that fountain be led,
made to cleanse my sins here below;
wash me in the blood that He shed,
and I shall be whiter than snow.
[3]
Father, I have wandered from Thee,
often has my heart gone astray;
crimson do my sins seem to me:
water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that fountain of Thine,
leaning on Thy promise I go,
cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
and I shall be whiter than snow.</Contents>

Blessed Lord, in Thee is refuge,
safety for my trembling soul,
power to lift my head when drooping,
‘midst the angry billows’ roll.
I will trust Thee, I will trust Thee, I will trust Thee,
all my life Thou shalt control.
[2]
In the past too unbelieving
‘midst the tempest I have been,
and my heart has slowly trusted
what my eyes have never seen.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
teach me on Thine arm to lean.
[3]
Oh, for trust that brings the triumph,
when defeat seems strangely near!
Oh, for faith that changes fighting
into victory’s ringing cheer!
Faith triumphant! faith triumphant! faith triumphant!
knowing not defeat or fear.
[4]
Faith triumphant - blessed victory!
Every barrier swept away!
Heaven descending, joy and fullness,
dawn of everlasting day!
Jesus only, Jesus only, Jesus only,
Him to love and Him obey.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.
[2]
Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.
[3]
We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear,
And often for each other flows
The sympathising tear.
[4]
When for a while we part,
This thought will soothe our pain,
That we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.
[5]
This glorious hope revives
Our courage by the way,
While each in expectation lives,
And longs to see the day.
[6]
From sorrow, toil and pain,
And sin we shall be free;
And perfect love and friendship reign
Through all eternity.</Contents>

That saveth me;
Give me to eat and live
With Thee above;
Teach me to love Thy truth,
For Thou art love.

O send Thy Spirit, Lord,
Now unto me,
That He may touch my eyes
And make me see;
Show me the truth concealed
Within Thy Word,
And in Thy Book revealed,
I see Thee, Lord.

Bless Thou the Bread of Life
To me, to me,
As Thou didst bless the loaves
By Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My all in all.</Contents>

Living for Christ, my members I yield,

sin is dethroned and Christ takes its place.
Glory be to God.

Growing in Christ; no more shall be named
things of which now I'm truly ashamed,
fruit unto holiness will I bear,
life evermore, the end I shall share.

Called unto holiness, Church of our God,
purchase of Jesus, redeemed by His blood;
called from the world and its idols to flee,
called from the bondage of sin to be free.
[chorus]
“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our 
watchword and song,
“Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re
marching along:
sing it, shout it, loud and long,
“Holiness unto the Lord,” now and
for ever.
[2]
Called unto holiness, children of light,
walking with Jesus in garments of white;
raiment unsullied, nor tarnished with sin,
God’s Holy Spirit abiding within.
[3]
Called unto holiness, praise His dear name,
this blessed secret to faith now made plain.
Not our own righteousness, but Christ within,
living and reigning, and saving from sin.
[4]
Called unto holiness, glorious thought!
Up from the wilderness wanderings brought
out from the shadows and darkness of night
into the Canaan of perfect delight.
[5]
“Called unto holiness,” Bride of the Lamb,
waiting the Bridegroom’s returning again;
lift up your heads, for the day draweth near
when in His beauty the King shall appear.</Contents>

Come down, O love divine,
Seek Thou this soul of mine
And visit it with Thine own ardour glowing;
O Comforter, draw near,
Within my heart appear,
And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.
[2]
O let it freely burn,
Till earthly passions turn
To dust and ashes, in its heat consuming;
And let Thy glorious light
Shine ever on my sight,
And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.
[3]
Let holy charity
Mine outward vesture be,
And lowliness become mine inner clothing;
True lowliness of heart,
Which takes the humbler part,
And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.
[4]
And so the yearning strong,
With which the soul will long,
Shall far outpass the power of human telling;
For none can guess its grace,
Till he become the place
Wherein the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling.</Contents>

Come, Jesus, Lord, with holy fire!
Come, and my quickened heart inspire,
cleansed in Thy precious blood.
Now to my soul Thyself reveal.
Thy mighty working let me feel,
since I am born of God.

Let nothing now my heart divide;
since with Thee I am crucified,
and live to God in Thee.
Dead to the world and all its toys,
its idle pomp, and fading joys,
Jesus my glory be!
[3]
Me with a quenchless thirst inspire,
a longing infinite desire,
and fill my craving heart.
Less than Thyself, oh, do not give,
in might Thyself within me live,
come, all Thou hast and art!
[4]
My will be swallowed up in Thee,
light in Thy light still may I see,
in Thine unclouded face;
called the full strength of trust to prove,
let all my quickened heart be love,
my spotless life be praise.</Contents>

Honour and power divine:

Be, Lord, forever Thine.

Conspire to lift Thy glories high,
And speak Thine endless praise.

Out of the heart of the Father above,
Streaming to me and to you:
Wonderful love
Dwells in the heart of the Father above.

Jesus, the Saviour, this gospel to tell,
Joyfully came;
Came with the helpless and hopeless to dwell,
Sharing their sorrow and shame;
Seeking the lost,
Saving, redeeming at measureless cost.
[3]
Jesus is seeking the wanderers yet;
Why do they roam?
Love only waits to forgive and forget;
Home, weary wanderer, home!
Wonderful love
Dwells in the heart of the Father above.
[4]
Come to my heart, O Thou wonderful love,
Come and abide,
Lifting my life, till it rises above
Envy and falsehood and pride,
Seeking to be
Lowly and humble, a learner of Thee.</Contents>

His coming like the morn shall be,

Come, O Thou Traveller unknown,
whom still I hold, but cannot see!
My company before is gone,
and I am left alone with Thee;
with Thee all night I mean to stay,
and wrestle till the break of day.
[2]
I need not tell Thee who I am,
my misery and sin declare;
Thyself hast called me by my name;
look on Thy hands, and read it there:
but who, I ask Thee, who art Thou?
Tell me Thy name, and tell me now.
[3]
In vain Thou strugglest to get free;
I never will unloose my hold!
Art Thou the Man that died for me?
The secret of Thy love unfold:
wrestling, I will not let Thee go,
till I Thy name, Thy nature know.
[4]
Yield to me now; for I am weak,
but confident in self-despair;
speak to my heart, in blessings speak,
be conquered by my instant prayer;
speak, or Thou never hence shalt move,
and tell me if Thy name is Love.
[5]
‘Tis Love! ‘tis Love! Thou diedst for me!
I hear Thy whisper in my heart;
the morning breaks, the shadows flee,
pure, universal Love Thou art;
to me, to all, Thy mercies move:
Thy nature and Thy name is Love.
[6]
I know Thee, Saviour, who Thou art,
Jesus, the feeble sinner’s Friend;
nor wilt Thou with the night depart,
but stay and love me to the end;
Thy mercies never shall remove:
Thy nature and Thy name is Love.</Contents>

Oh, let Thy sacred presence fill,

While in this region here below,
no other good will I pursue;
I bid this world of noise and show,

Wealth, honour, pleasure, and what else

tempt as ye will, my soul repels,

Henceforth let no profane delight
divide this consecrated soul;
possess it Thou, who hast the right,
as Lord and Master of the whole.

with pure delight and inward bliss;
to know Thou takest me for Thine own;
oh, what a happiness is this!</Contents>

Redemption ground, the ground of peace!
Redemption ground, oh, wondrous grace!
Here let our praise to God abound,
who saves us on redemption ground.
[2]
Once from my God I wandered far,
and with His holy will made war:
but now my songs to God abound;
I’m standing on redemption ground.
[3]
Oh, joyous hour when God to me
a vision gave of Calvary:
my bonds were loosed, my soul unbound;
I sang upon redemption ground.
[4]
No works of merit now I plead,
but Jesus take for all my need;
no righteousness in me is found,
except upon redemption ground.
[5]
Come, weary soul, and here find rest;
accept redemption, and be blest:
the Christ, who died, by God is crowned
to pardon on redemption ground.</Contents>

Come, sinners, to Jesus! no longer delay,
a full, free salvation He offers to-day;
arouse your dark spirits, awake from your dream,
And Christ will support you in coming 
to Him.
[chorus]
For the Lion of Judah shall break every chain,
And give us the vict’ry again and again.
For the Lion of Judah shall break every chain,
And give us the vict’ry again and again.
[2]
Our blessed Redeemer was nailed to the tree,
to open a fountain for sinners like me,
His blood is the fountain that pardon bestows,
and cleanses the foulest wherever it flows.
[3]
And when I was willing with all things to part,
He gave me my bounty, His love in my heart,
so now I am joined with the conquering band,
who are marching to glory at Jesus’ command.
[4]
Though round me the storms of adversity roll,
and the waves of destruction encompass my soul,
in vain this frail vessel the tempest shall toss,
my hopes rest secure on the blood of the cross.
[5]
And when with the ransomed of Jesus my Head,
from fountain to fountain I then shall be led
I’ll fall at His feet and His mercy adore,
and sing of the blood of the cross evermore.</Contents>

Come, Thou burning Spirit, come!
Lo! we stretch our hands to Thee,
from the Father to the Son,
let us now Thy glory see.
[chorus]
Come, oh come, Great Spirit, come!
Let the mighty deed be done,
satisfy our souls’ desire,
see us waiting for the fire,
waiting, waiting,
see us waiting for the fire.
[2]
On the altar now we lay
soul and body, mind and will;
all the evil passions slay,
come and every corner fill.
[3]
Now the sacrifice we make,
though as dear as a right eye,
for our blessed Saviour’s sake,
who for us did bleed and die.
[4]
Now, by faith, the gift I claim,
bought for me by blood Divine;
through the all-prevailing Name,
all the promises are mine.</Contents>

Come, Thou everlasting Spirit,
bring to every thankful mind
all the Saviour’s dying merit,
all His sufferings for mankind:
true Recorder of His passion,
now the living faith impart;
now reveal His great salvation
unto every faithful heart.
[2]
Come, Thou witness of His dying;
come, Remembrancer divine;
let us feel Thy power applying
Christ to every soul, and mine;
let us groan Thine inward groaning,
look on Him we pierced, and grieve;
all partake the grace atoning, 
all the sprinkled blood receive.
[3]
Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth;
I in Him, and He in me!
And my empty soul He filleth,
here and through eternity.
Thus I wait for His returning,
singing all the way to heaven;
such the joyous song of morning,
such the banquet song of even.</Contents>

Come, thou fount of ev'ry blessing,
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above;
praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it,
mount of thy redeeming love.
[2]
O to grace, how great a debtor,
daily I'm constrained to be,
let thy grace, Lord, like a fetter,
bind my wand'ring heart to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it;
seal it for thy courts above.</Contents>

Come if your heart is searching
Come if your soul is thirsty
Draw near and drink of the mercy of Jesus Christ
At the river of life

There is a river whose streams make glad
The city of God, the city of God
So come if you're wounded or sad
There is a river, there is a river

It flows from the land of eternal life
Where there's no more sorrow and no more night
Into the hearts that are lifted to Him
Filling His children again and again</Contents>

Come with me, visit Calvary,

His blood, it fills the fountain,
‘tis full, ‘tis deep, ‘tis wide.
He died from sin to sever
our hearts and lives complete;
He saves and keeps for ever
those lying at His feet.
[chorus]
To the uttermost He saves,
to the uttermost He saves,
dare you now believe and His love
receive,
to the uttermost Jesus saves.
[2]
I will surrender fully,
and do His blessed will;
His blood doth make me holy,
His presence me doth fill.
He’s saving, I’m believing,
this blessing now I claim;
His Spirit I’m receiving,
my heart is in a flame.
[3]
I’ve wondrous peace through trusting,
a well of joy within;
this rest is everlasting,
each day I triumph win.
He gives me heavenly measure
pressed down and running o’er,
oh, what a priceless treasure,
glory for evermore!</Contents>

Come, ye thankful people, come,
Raise the song of harvest home!
All is safely gathered in
Ere the winter storms begin;
God, our Maker, doth provide
For our needs to be supplied;
Come to God's own temple, come,
Raise the song of harvest-home.
[2]
All the world is God's own field,
Fruit unto His praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown,
Unto joy or sorrow grown;
First the blade, and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear:
Lord of harvest, grant that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.
[3]
For the Lord our God shall come
And shall take His harvest home,
From His field shall in that day
All offences purge away,

Give His angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast,
But the fruitful ears to store
In His garner evermore.
[4]
Even so, Lord, quickly come,
Bring Thy final harvest home;
Gather Thou Thy people in,
Free from sorrow, free from sin;
There, forever purified,
In Thy garner to abide:
Come, with all Thine angels, come,
Raise the glorious harvest-home.</Contents>

We’re marching to Zion!
Beautiful, beautiful Zion!
We’re marching upward to Zion,

Let those refuse to sing
who never knew our God;
but children of the heavenly King,
but children of the heavenly King
must speak their joys abroad,

The hill of Zion yields
a thousand sacred sweets,
before we reach the heavenly fields, before we reach the heavenly fields
or walk the golden streets,
or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound,
and every tear be dry:
we’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
we’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
to fairer worlds on high,

Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne;
Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.
[2]
Crown Him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save:
His glories now we sing,
Who died and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die.
[3]
Crown Him the Lord of love;
Behold His hands and side,
Those wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified:
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends His burning eye
At mysteries so bright.
[4]
Crown Him the Lord of peace,
Whose power a sceptre sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
And all be prayer and praise:
His reign shall know no end,
And round His piercèd feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet.
[5]
Crown Him the Lord of years,
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime!
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
Throughout eternity.</Contents>

Day by day, and with each passing moment,
Strength I find to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment.
I've no cause for worry or for fear.

He, whose heart is kind beyond all measure,
Gives unto each day what He deems best,
Lovingly its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest. 
[2]
Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me,
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me.
He whose name is Counsellor and Pow'r.

The protection of His child and treasure
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
'As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,'
- This the pledge to me He made. </Contents>

Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
Forgive our foolish ways;
Reclothe us in our rightful mind;
In purer lives Thy service find,
In deeper reverence, praise,
In deeper reverence, praise.

In simple trust like theirs who heard,
Beside the Syrian sea,
The gracious calling of the Lord,
Let us, like them, without a word
Rise up and follow Thee,
Rise up and follow Thee.
[3]
O sabbath rest by Galilee!
O calm of hills above,
Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee
The silence of eternity,
Interpreted by love,
Interpreted by love.
[4]
With that deep hush subduing all
Our words and works that drown
The tender whisper of Thy call,
As noiseless let Thy blessing fall
As fell Thy manna down,
As fell Thy manna down.
[5]
Drop Thy still dews of quietness,
Till all our strivings cease;
Take from our souls the strain and stress,
And let our ordered lives confess
The beauty of Thy peace,
The beauty of Thy peace.
[6]
Breathe through the heats of our desire
Thy coolness and Thy balm;
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire,
O still small voice of calm,
O still small voice of calm!</Contents>

Depth of mercy! can there be

grieved Him by a thousand falls.

Whence to me this waste of love?
Ask my Advocate above!
See the cause in Jesus’ face,

There for me the Saviour stands,
shows His wounds and spreads His hands:
God is love, I know, I feel:
Jesus lives, and loves me still.

bow Thine ear, in mercy bow,
pardon and accept me now!</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Did you ever talk to God above
Telling Him you need a friend to love
Pray in Jesus' name believing that
God answers prayer.
[2]
Have you told Him all your cares and worries
Every tiny little fear He knows
You can know He'll always hear
And He will answer prayer
[3]
You can whisper in a crowd to Him
You can cry when you're alone to Him
You don't have to pray out loud to Him
He knows your thoughts
[4]
On a lofty mountain peak, He's there
In a meadow by a stream, He's there
Anywhere on earth you go
He's been there from the start
[5]
Find the answer in His Word, it's true
You'll be strong because He walks with you
By faithfulness He'll changes you too
God answers prayer</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Do you ever search your heart,
As you watch the day depart.
Is there something way down deep
you try to hide?
If this day should be the end,
And eternity began,
When the book is open wide,
Would the Lord be satisfied?
[chorus]
Is He satisfied? is He satisfied?
Is He satisfied with me?
Have I done my best, have I stood the test?
Is He satisfied with me?

When my Lord shall come again,
When He walks and talks with man,
What if every friend He had 
were just like me?

Would He feel welcome here?
Or would He go away in tears?
Am I all that I should be?
Is He satisfied with me?
[2]
Feeble is the lamp of fame,
By which man inscribes his name,
On the walls of time for other 
men to see.
Though he boast of wealth and power,
None can help him in that hour,
When the angels hear His plea,
Is He satisfied with me.</Contents>

Do you know that you've been born again?
Do you know that you've been born again?
Does the Spirit dwell within,      
bearing witness that you've been    
cleansed from ev'ry  sin and stain?
Are you ready if the Lord should come,
Or today your soul should claim?
Can you face eternal years free from    
doubt and dread and fears?
Do you know, know, know, that
you've been born again?
[2]
Yes I know that I've been born again.
Yes I know  that I've been born again.
For the Spirit dwells within, 
bearing witness that I've been
cleansed from ev'ry sin and stain;
I am ready if the Lord should come.
Or today my soul should claim;
I can face eternal years free from
doubt and dread and fears.
Yes, I know, know, know, that 
I've been born again!</Contents>

In the dark night, He is protectingyou.

Jesus is with you whatever you do.

Doubt Him not, although He leadeth
other ways than hope had said;
all the grace thy spirit needeth
dwells in Him.  Be not afraid!
[chorus]
I will trust Thee - yes, will trust Thee!
Nought I need of other aid;
All sufficient Thou, my Saviour!
Never will I be afraid.
[2]
Fret thee not about the morrow;
faint thou not for hope delayed;
He will lead, through joy, through sorrow
to thy Home. Be not afraid!
[3]
Does some fierce temptation try thee?
Look to Him who bruised its head;
see the Conqueror standing by thee;
trust in Him. Be not afraid!
[4]
Faileth all of earth’s reliance?
Do thy “vine and fig-tree” fade?
Thou canst bid all foes defiance
through thy Lord. Be not afraid!
[5]
Does there come a time of testing,
when thine all of strength seems fled?
His strength then on thee is resting
if thou trust. Be not afraid!
[6]
Trusting thus and trusting ever,
on the Lord Jehovah stayed.
Thou at last shalt ford the river
safe, through Him.  Be not afraid!</Contents>

there to my heart was the blood applied;
glory to His name!

Glory to His name!

Now to my heart is the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within,
here at the cross where He took me in;
glory to His name!

Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
here Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
glory to His name!

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet,
cast thy poor soul at the Saviour’s feet,
plunge in today and be made complete;
glory to His name!</Contents>

Down from His glory, ever-living story,
my God and Saviour came, and Jesus was His name;
born in a manger, to His own a stranger,
a man of sorrows, tears and agony!
[chorus]
O how I love Him! how I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, my all-in-all!
The great Creator became my Saviour,
and all God’s fulness dwelleth in Him!
[2]
What condescension, bringing us redemption,
that in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight;
God, gracious, tender, laid aside His splendour,
stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.
[3]
Without reluctance, flesh and blood, His substance,
He took the form of man, revealed the hidden plan;
O glorious mystery, sacrifice of Calvary!
And now I know He is the great ‘I AM’!</Contents>

Drawn to the Cross which Thou hast blessed,
with healing gifts for souls distressed,
to find in Thee my Life, my Rest,
Christ crucified, I come.

Weary of selfishness and pride,
false pleasures gone, vain hopes denied,
deep in Thy wounds my shame to hide,
Christ crucified, I come.

Wash me, and take away each stain,
let nothing of my sin remain;
for cleansing, though it be through pain,
Christ crucified, I come.

A life of labour, prayers and love,
which shall my heart's conversion prove,
till to a glorious rest above,
Christ crucified, I come.
[5]
To share with Thee Thy Life divine,
Thy Righteousness, Thy Likeness mine,
since Thou hast made my nature Thine,
Christ crucified, I come.
[6]
To be what Thou woulds't have me be,
accepted, sanctified in Thee,
through what Thy grace shall work in me,
Christ crucified, I come.</Contents>

Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;

Moment by moment I’m kept in His
love,
moment by moment I’ve life fromabove;
looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
[2]
Never a battle with wrong for the right,
never a contest that He doth not fight;
lifting above us His banner so whitemoment by moment I’m kept in His
sight.
[3]
Never a trial that He is not there,
never a burden that He doth not bear,
never a sorrow that He doth not share
moment by moment I'm under His care.
[4]
Never a heart-ache, and never a groan,
never a tear-drop, and never a moan;
never a danger but there on the throne,
moment by moment He thinks of His
own.
[5]
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
never a sickness that He cannot heal;
moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus my Saviour abides with me still.</Contents>

Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

O Christ, whose voice the waters heard,
And hushed their raging at Thy word,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
And calm amid the storm didst sleep:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
[3]
O Holy Spirit, who didst brood
Upon the waters dark and rude,
And bid their angry tumult cease,
And give, for wild confusion, peace:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
[4]
O Trinity of love and power,
Our brethren shield in danger's hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe'er they go:
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.</Contents>

Eternal Light! Eternal Light!
How pure the soul must be,
when, placed within Thy searching sight,
it shrinks not, but, with calm delight,
can live, and look on Thee!
[2]
The spirits that surround Thy throne
may bear the burning bliss;
but that is surely theirs alone,
since they have never, never known
a fallen world like this.
[3]
Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere
is dark, whose mind is dim,
before the Ineffable appear,
and on my naked spirit bear
the uncreated beam?
[4]
There is a way for man to rise
to that sublime abode:
an offering and a sacrifice,
a Holy Spirit’s energies,
an advocate with God;
[5]
These, these prepare us for the sight
of holiness above:
the sons of ignorance and night
may dwell in the eternal light,
through the eternal love!</Contents>

Everybody seems to have 
A cause for which to speak,
Loudly from the roof tops 
They proclaim the things they seek.
Often or a needless cause
And often to deceive,
Should not we who know the Lord
Declare what we believe.

Let the whole world know,
We are on God's side (FOREVER!)
Let the whole world know,
He's a friend and guide (along the pathway!)
For in Christ new life we found,
And our lives were changed around,
Now we travel heaven bound,
Let the whole world know!
[3]
Let the whole world know,
There's a job to do (We'll do it)
Let the whole world know,
Others need Him too (They surely need Him)
Like a brightly shining light,
In the darkness of the night,
We will stand for truth and right,
Let the whole world know.</Contents>

Everyday they pass me by,
I can see it in their eyes,
Empty people filled with care,
Headed who knows where.
On they go through private pain,
Living fear to fear,
Laughter hides their silent cries,
Only Jesus hears.
[chorus]
People need the Lord,
People need the Lord,
At the end of broken dreams,
He's the open door.
People need the Lord,
People need the Lord,
When will we realise,
People need the Lord.
[2]
We are called to take His light,
To a world where wrong seems right,
What could be too great a cost,
For sharing life with one who's lost.
Through His love our hearts can feel,
All the grief they bear,
They must hear the words of life,
Only we can share.</Contents>

He will always guide you in his way
And when Jesus comes again
Your life will be fulfilled

Welcomed in to the courts of the King
I've been ushered into Your presence.
Lord I stand on Your merciful ground
Yet with every step tread wityh reverence
[chorus]
And I'll fall face down
As Your glory shines around   x2
[2]
There is none in the heavens like You
And upon earth who's Your equal.
You are far above, you're the highest of heights
I am bowing down to exalt You
[bridge]
So let Your glory shine around
Let Your glory shine around
King of glory there be found
King of glory  x3</Contents>

Face to face with Christ my Saviour,
face to face: what will it be
when with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ who died for me?
[chorus]
Face to face shall I behold Him,
far beyond the starry sky;
face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
[2]
Only faintly now I see Him,
with the darkling veil between,
but a blessed day is coming,
when His glory shall be seen.
[3]
What rejoicing in His presence,
when are banished grief and pain;
when the crooked ways are straightened
and the dark things shall be plain.
[4]
Face to face! O blissful moment!
Face to face, to see and know!
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ who loves me so.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Facing a task unfinished,
that drives us to our knees,
a need that, undiminished,
rebukes our slothful ease.
We who rejoice to know Thee,
renew before Thy throne
the solemn pledge we owe Thee,
to go and make Thee known.
[2]
Where other lords beside Thee
hold their unhindered sway,
where forces that defied Thee
defy Thee still today,
with none to heed their crying
for life, and love, and light,
unnumbered souls are dying,
and pass into the night.
[3]
We bear the torch that, flaming,
fell from the hands of those
who gave their lives, proclaiming
that Jesus died and rose.
Ours is the same commission,
the same glad message ours,
fired by the same ambition,
to Thee we yield our powers.
[4]
O Father who sustained them,
O Spirit who inspired,
Saviour, whose love constrained them
to toil with zeal untired.
From cowardice defend us,
from lethargy awake!
Forth on Thine errands send us
to labour for Thy sake.</Contents>

“Far above all” is our Saviour enthroned;                  
crowned is the Lamb who for sinners atoned,
living for ever, to list to our call,
God hath exalted Him “far above all.”
[chorus]
Far above all, far above all!.
Jesus the Crucified, “far above all!”
Low at His footstool adoring we fall,
God hath exalted Him “far above all.”
[2]
When the fierce tempest, uplifting its waves,                                
seeks to engulf us, we cry and He saves;
looking to Jesus, upheld by His hand,
tread we the billows as safe as on land.
[3]
High are the cities that dare our assault,                               
strong are the barriers that call us to halt; 
march we on fearless, and down they must fall,                                  
vanquished by faith in Him “far above
all.”
[4]
His is the kingdom from pole unto pole,                                   
“Far above all” while the ages shall roll.
With Him the victors, who followed His call,
share in His royalty “far above all.”</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling,
then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand;
doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling,
none of these shall move me from Beulah
Land.
[chorus]
I’m living on the mountain, 
underneath a cloudless sky,
I’m drinking at the fountain that
never shall run dry,
oh, yes! I’m feasting on the manna
from a bountiful supply,
for I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
[2]
Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,
sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand;
safe am I within the castle of God’s Word retreating,
nothing then can reach me, ‘tis Beulah Land.
[3]
Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me,
I am safely sheltered here protected by God’s hand;
here the sun is always shining, here there’s naught can harm me,
I am safe for ever in Beulah Land.
[4]
Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,
hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way is planned;
dwelling in the Spirit, here I learn of full salvation,
gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.</Contents>

Far, far away in heathen darkness dwelling,
millions of souls for ever may be lost;
who, who will go, salvation's story telling,
looking to Jesus, counting not the cost?
[chorus]
“All power is given unto Me!
All power is given unto Me!
Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel;
and, lo, I am with you always.”
[2]
See o'er the world, wide open doors inviting:
soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!
Christians, awake! your forces all uniting,
send forth the gospel, break the chains 
of sin.
[3]
“Why will ye die?” the voice of God is calling;
“Why will ye die?” re-echo in His Name:
Jesus hath died to save from death appalling;
life and salvation, therefore, go proclaim.
[4]
God speed the day when those of every nation,
“Glory to God!” triumphantly shall sing;
ransomed, redeemed, rejoicing in salvation,
shout, “Hallelujah, for the Lord is King!”</Contents>

Father, although I cannot see
the future You have planned,
and though the path is sometimes dark
and hard to understand:
yet give me faith, through joy and pain,
to trace Your loving hand.

When I recall that in the past
Your promises have stood
through each perplexing circumstance
and every changing mood,
I rest content that all things work
together for my good.
[3]
Whatever, then, the future brings
of good or seeming ill,
I ask for strength to follow You
and grace to trust You still;
and I would look for no reward,
except to do Your will.</Contents>

Father, hear the prayer we offer:
Not for ease that prayer shall be,
But for strength, that we may ever
Live our lives courageously.
[2]
Not for ever in green pastures
Do we ask our way to be:
But by steep and rugged pathways
Would we strive to climb to Thee.
[3]
Not for ever by still waters
Would we idly quiet stay;
But would smite the living fountains
From the rocks along our way.
[4]
Be our strength in hours of weakness,
In our wanderings be our Guide;
Through endeavour, failure, danger,
Father, be Thou at our side.
[5]
Let our path be bright or dreary,
Storm or sunshine be our share;
May our souls, in hope unweary,
Make Thy work our ceaseless prayer.</Contents>

Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God,
In every part with praise,
That my whole being may proclaim
Thy being and Thy ways.
[2]
Not for the lip of praise alone,
Nor e'en the praising heart
I ask, but for a life made up
Of praise in every part:
[3]
Praise in the common things of life,
Its goings out and in;
Praise in each duty and each deed,
However small and mean.
[4]
Fill every part of me with praise;
Let all my being speak
Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,
Poor though I be and weak.
[5]
So shall Thou, gracious Lord, from me
Receive the glory due;
And so shall I begin on earth
The song forever new.
[6]
So shall no part of day or night
From sacredness be free;
But all my life, in every step,
Be fellowship with Thee.</Contents>

How I long to sing Your praise
Worship You Lord in Your presence
Father of mercy and grace
Come and abide in me

Jesus Lord of glory 
Brings me to my knees
Crush the 'I' Lord
Crush the 'pride'
Be glorified in me

I will fly like an eagle
Soaring on the breezes of Your love
Hear Your whisper
Draw me closer to You
Fill me Lord with Holy fire
You perfect will, my heart's desire
And I will fly, Lord
And I will soar like an eagle

For a fresh anointing, Lord, for service
come we now in Jesus’ precious name;
for the blessed Pentecostal fullness,
every heart with heavenly love aflame.
[chorus]
Send a new touch of fire on our souls, Lord.
Send it now, Lord. Send it now, Lord.
Touch our lips today with the living coals.
Send a new touch of fire on our souls.
[2]
Make us free to tell the gospel story;
liberty in service may we have,
showing forth the Saviour’s grace and glory,
telling of His wondrous power to save.
[3]
Bringing all we have in consecration
as a living sacrifice for Thee;
trusting for an uttermost salvation,
Jesus’ precious blood our only plea.
[4]
Let the great Refiner throughly purge us,
purify our hearts like as by fire;
while for all the sanctifying fullness
here our waiting, longing hearts aspire.</Contents>

Although the world His love neglect,
I never will cease to praise Him;
I could not such a friend reject.
I never will cease to praise Him;

He saves me every day and hour;
I never will cease to praise Him;
just now I feel His cleansing power.
I never will cease to praise Him;

While on my journey here below,
I never will cease to praise Him.
And when to that bright world I go,
I never will cease to praise Him;</Contents>

For all the saints, who from their labours rest,
Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[2]
Thou wast their Rock, their fortress, and their might;
Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;
Thou in the darkness drear their one true light.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[3]
O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
And win, with them, the victor's crown of gold!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[4]
O blest communion, fellowship divine!
We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
Yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[5]
And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[6]
The golden evening brightens in the west;
Soon, soon to faithful warriors cometh rest;
Sweet is the calm of paradise the blest.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[7]
But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;
The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
The King of glory passes on His way.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[8]
From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,
Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
Singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!</Contents>

For ever with the Lord!
Amen, so let it be;
life from the dead is in that word,
‘tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
absent from Him I roam,
yet nightly pitch my moving tent,
a day’s march nearer home.
[2]
My Father’s house on high,
home of my soul; how near
at times to faith’s foreseeing eye
Thy golden gates appear:
my thirsty spirit faints
to reach the land I love;
the bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.
[3]
For ever with the Lord!
Father, if ‘tis Thy will,
the promise of that faithful word
e’en here to me fulfil!
Be Thou at my right hand,
then can I never fail;
uphold Thou me so I shall stand,
fight, and I must prevail.
[4]
So, when my latest breath
shall rend the veil in twain,
by death I shall escape from death
and life eternal gain.
Knowing as I am known,
how shall I love that word!
And oft repeat before the throne:
For ever with the Lord!</Contents>

“For My sake and the gospel's, go
and tell redemption's story”;
His heralds answer, “Be it so,
and Thine, Lord, all the glory!”
They preach His birth, His life, His Cross,
the love of His atonement,
for whom they count the world but loss,
His Easter, His enthronement.
[2]
Hark, hark, the trump of jubilee
proclaims to every nation,
from pole to pole, by land and sea,
glad tidings of salvation.
As nearer draws the day of doom,
while still the battle rages,
the heavenly day-spring, through the gloom,
breaks on the night of ages.
[3]
Still on and on the anthems spread
of  hallelujah voices,
in concert with the holy dead
the warrior-church rejoices;
their snow-white robes are washed in blood,
their golden harps are ringing;
earth and the paradise of God
one triumph-song are singing.
[4]
He comes, whose advent trumpet drowns
the last of time's evangels;
Emmanuel crowned with many crowns,
the Lord of saints and angels:
O Life, Light, Love, the great I AM,
triune, who changest never;
the throne of God and of the Lamb
is Thine, and Thine for ever!</Contents>

To our race so freely given,

Flowers of earth, and buds of heaven:

And still to things eternal look,
And hasten to Thy glorious day.

From every stain made clean,
from every sin set free;
oh, blessed Lord, this is the gift
that Thou hast promised me.
And pressing through the past
of failure, fault, and fear,
before Thy cross my all I cast,
and dare to leave it there.
[2]
From Thee I would not hide
my sin because of fear
what men may think; I hate my pride,
and as I am appear.
Just as I am, O Lord,
not what I'm thought to be;
just as I am, a struggling soul
for life and liberty.
[3]
While in Thy light I stand,
my heart, I seem to see,
has failed to take from Thine own hand
the gifts it offers me.
O Lord, Thy plenteous grace,
Thy wisdom and Thy power,
I here proclaim before Thy face,
can keep me every hour.
[4]
Upon the altar here
I lay my treasure down;
I only want to have Thee near,
King of my heart to crown.
The fire doth surely burn
my every selfish claim;
and while from them to Thee I turn,
I trust in Thy great name.
[5]
A heart by blood made clean,
in every wish and thought;
a heart that by God's power has been
into subjection brought;
to walk, to weep, to sing,
within the light of heaven;
this is the blessing, Saviour, King,
that Thou to me hast given!</Contents>

From every stormy wind that blows,

‘tis found beneath the Mercy seat.

There is a place where Jesus sheds
the oil of gladness on our heads;
a place than all beside more sweet
it is the blood-stained Mercy seat.
[3]
There is a scene where spirits blend,
where friend holds fellowship with friend;
though scattered far, by faith we meet
around one common Mercy seat.
[4]
There, there, on eagle’s wings we soar,
till sense and sin molest no more,
and heaven comes down our souls to greet,
and glory crowns the Mercy seat!</Contents>

From the heart whose cup o'erfloweth,
from the crowned life,
from the souls made more than
conquerors
in the midst of strife,
rises one glad “Hallelujah”
to the King of love,
as a fragrance sweet ascending
to His throne above.
[chorus]
Praise to Thee who hast redeemed us,
O all-glorious King!
Now and through the endless ages
shall Thy praises ring,
shall Thy praises ring, 
shall Thy praises ring. 
Now and through the endless ages
shall Thy praises ring.
[2]
Praise for all the full deliverance
of Thy wondrous Cross,
where to death our life we yielded,
that most blessed loss.
Praise for that deep, boundless ocean
of the life in Thee,
and the anointing of Thy Spirit
which hath set us free.
[3]
Praise for all Thy grace untasted
lying yet before,
and the things past understanding
Thou hast kept in store.
Praise for life within the Holiest
even now begun,
for the radiance pure and holy 
of the unsetting Sun.
[4]
But past all the bliss Thou sheddest
on the yielded heart,
we would praise Thee and adore Thee,
Lord, for what Thou art.
Evermore in lowly worship
bending at Thy feet,
till within the gates of glory
face to face we meet.</Contents>

Full Salvation! full Salvation!
lo! the fountain opened wide
streams through every land and nation
from the Saviour's wounded side.
Full Salvation! Full Salvation!
Full Salvation! Full Salvation!
Streams an endless crimson tide.
[2]
Oh, the glorious revelation!
See the cleansing current flow,
washing stains of condemnation
whiter than the driven snow!
Full Salvation!
Oh!  the rapturous bliss to know!
[3]
Love's resistless current sweeping
all the regions deep within;
thought and wish and senses keeping
now, and every instant, clean.
Full Salvation!
from the guilt and power of sin.
[4]
Life immortal, heaven descending,
lo! my heart the Spirit's shrine!
God and man in oneness blending,
oh, what fellowship is mine!
Full Salvation!
Raised in Christ to life divine!
[5]
Care and doubting, gloomy sorrow,
fear and grief are mine no more;
faith knows naught of dark tomorrow
for my Saviour goes before.
Full Salvation!
full and free for evermore.</Contents>

My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning.
Oh Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer
Unto Thee and will look up.</Contents>

Give me a sight, O Saviour,

of the love that brought Thee down to earth,
to die on Calvary.
[chorus]
Oh, make me understand it,
help me to take it in,
what it meant to Thee, the Holy One,
to bear away my sin.
[2]
Was it the nails, O Saviour,
that bound Thee to the tree?
Nay, ‘twas Thine everlasting love,
Thy love for me, for me.
[3]
Oh, wonder of all wonders,
that through Thy death for me,
my open sins, my secret sins,
can all forgiven be.
[4]
Then melt my heart, O Saviour,
bend me, yea, break me down,
until I own Thee Conqueror,
and Lord and Sovereign crown.</Contents>

vision of souls and a world in need:
loved ones and friends, the one next
door,
then let me see there are millions more.
[chorus]
Give me a vision,
heart-stirring vision,
open my eyes, Lord, today;
show me the sighing,
doomed and the dying,
give me a vision, I pray.
[2]
Give me a vision, Lord divine,
kindle with fire this cold heart of mine;
may with unselfishness it burn,
fill me with love and a deep concern.
[3]
Give me a vision, Lord divine,
so charged with power that it shall shine
out to the lost in deepest night,
wandering alone in their sad, sad plight.
[4]
Give me a vision, Lord divine,
without a limit or boundary line;
help me to see a world in sin,
not just the field I am working in.</Contents>

Give me the faith that can remove
and sink the mountain to a plain:
give me the child-like praying love
which longs to build Thy house again:
Thy love let it my heart o'erpower,
and all my yearning soul devour!
[2]
I would the precious time redeem,
and longer live for this alone,
to spend and to be spent for them
who have not yet my Saviour known;
and turn them to a pardoning God,
and quench the brands in Jesus' blood.
[3]
My talents, gifts, and graces, Lord,
into Thy blessed hands receive;
and let me live to preach Thy word;
and let me to Thy glory live;
my every sacred moment spend
in publishing the sinners' Friend.
[4]
Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart
with boundless charity divine!
So shall I all my strength exert,
and love them with a zeal like Thine;
and lead them to Thy open side,
the sheep for whom their Shepherd died.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God!
He whose word cannot be broken
Formed thee for His own abode.
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.
[2]
See! The streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove;
Who can faint, whilst such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord, the Giver,
Never fails from age to age.
[3]
Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear!
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near.
He who gives them daily manna,
He who listens when they cry:
Let Him hear the loud hosanna
Rising to His throne on high.
[4]
Saviour, if of Zion's city
I, through grace, a member am,
Let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in Thy name.
Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show,
Solid joys and lasting treasure
None but Zion's children know.</Contents>

Glory to Thee; Thou Son of God most High,
all praise to Thee!
Glory to Thee, enthroned above the sky,
who died for me;
high on Thy throne, Thine ear, Lord Jesus bend
as grateful hearts now to Thyself ascend.
[2]
Deep were Thy sorrows, Lord, when heaven frowned -
Gethsemane!
Bloodlike Thy sweat, Lord, falling to the ground
so heavily;
dark was the night, but heaven was darker still,
O Christ my God, is this the Father’s will?
[3]
Thorns wreathed Thy brow when hanging on the tree,
man’s cruelty!
Why lavish love like this, O Lord, on me?
Thou lovest me!
Would that my soul could understand its length,
its breadth, depth, height, and everlasting strength!
[4]
Thy precious blood was freely shed for me
on Calvary
to save me from a lost eternity;
glory to Thee!
Nor death, nor hell, nor things below - above
can sever me from Thy eternal love.
[5]
Like shoreless seas, Thy love can know no bound;
Thou lovest me!
Deep, vast, immense, unfathomed, Lord, profound,
Lord, I love Thee!
And when above, my crown is at Thy feet,
I’ll praise Thee still for Calvary’s 
mercy seat.</Contents>

Go forth and tell! O Church of God, awake!
God's saving news to all the nations take:
proclaim Christ Jesus, Saviour, Lord and King,
that all the world His worthy praise may sing.

Go forth and tell! God's love embraces all;
He will in grace respond to all who call:
how shall they call if they have never heard
the gracious invitation of His word?
[3]
Go forth and tell! men still in darkness lie;
in wealth or want, in sin they live and die:
give us, O Lord, concern of heart and mind,
a love like Yours which cares for all mankind.
[4]
Go forth and tell! the doors are open wide:
share God's good gifts - let no one be denied;
live out your life as Christ your Lord shall choose,
Your ransomed powers for His sole glory use.
[5]
Go forth and tell! O church of God, arise!
Go in the strength which Christ your Lord supplies;
go till all nations His great name adore
and serve Him, Lord and King for evermore.</Contents>

but this I know:
I have the smiling of his face

for what I cannot, he can see
and in his care I saved shall be

    <Contents>[1]
God in heaven hath a treasure,
riches none may count or tell;
hath a deep eternal pleasure,
Christ, the Son, He loveth well.
God hath here on earth a treasure,
none but He its price may know,
deep unfathomable pleasure,
Christ revealed in saints below.
[2]
God, in tongues of fire descending,
chosen vessels thus to fill,
with the treasure never ending,
ever spent, unfailing still.
God’s own hand the vessel filling
from the glory far above,
longing hearts for ever stilling
with the riches of His love.
[3]
Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted,
glorious calling, saint, is thine;
let the Lord but find thee emptied,
living branch in Christ the Vine!
Vessels of the world's despising,
vessels weak, and poor, and base,
bearing wealth God’s heart is prizing
glory from Christ’s blessed face.
[4]
Oh to be but emptier, lowlier,
mean, unnoticed, and unknown,
and to God a vessel holier,
filled with Christ and Christ alone!
Naught of earth to cloud the glory
naught of self the light to dim,
telling forth His wondrous story,
emptied, to be filled with Him.</Contents>

Thou art in us, in Thy temple,
so our hearts in silence thrill
while we wait to hear the whisper
of the blessed Master's will.
We are in Thee, in the Holiest,
here our prayers and praise ascend;
in Thy secret place abiding,
till the battle din shall end.</Contents>

God is here, and that to bless us
with the Spirit's quickening power;
see, the cloud already bending,
waits to drop the grateful shower.
[chorus]
Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee,
let the shower of blessing fall;
we are waiting, we are waiting,
oh, revive the hearts of all.
[2]
God is here! We feel His presence
in this consecrated place:
but we need the soul refreshing
of His free, unbounded grace.
[3]
God is here! Oh, then, believing,
bring to Him our one desire,
that His love may now be kindled,
till its flame each heart inspire.
[4]
Saviour, grant the prayer we offer,
while in simple faith we bow!
From the windows of Thy mercy
pour us out a blessing now.</Contents>

God is our refuge and our strength,
in straits a present aid;
therefore, although the earth remove,
we will not be afraid.
[2]
Though hills amidst the seas be cast;
though waters roaring make,
and troubled be; yea, though the hills
by swelling seas do shake.
[3]
A river is, whose streams make glad
the city of our God,
the holy place, wherein the Lord
most high hath his abode.
[4]
God in the midst of her doth dwell;
nothing shall her remove:
God unto her an helper will,
and that right early, prove.
[5]
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
the God whom we adore,
be glory, as it was, and is,
and shall be evermore.  Amen.</Contents>

God is working His purpose out,
As year succeeds to year;
God is working His purpose out,
And the time is drawing near;
Nearer and nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God,
As the waters cover the sea.
[2]
From utmost East to utmost West,
Where'er man's foot hath trod,
By the mouth of many messengers
Goes forth the voice of God;
Give ear to Me, ye continents,
Ye isles, give ear to Me,
That the earth may be filled
With the glory of God,
As the waters cover the sea.
[3]
March we forth in the strength of God
With the banner of Christ unfurled,
That the light of the glorious gospel of truth
May shine throughout the world:
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin,
To set their captives free,
That the earth may be filled
With the glory of God,
As the waters cover the sea.
[4]
All we can do is nothing worth,
Unless God blesses the deed;
Vainly we hope for the harvest-tide
Till God gives life to the seed;
Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God,
As the waters cover the sea.</Contents>

God loved the world of sinners, lost

salvation full, at highest cost,
He offers free to all.
[chorus]
Oh, ‘twas love, ‘twas wondrous love,
the love of God to me;
it brought my Saviour from above,
to die on Calvary.
[2]
E’en now, by faith, I claim Him mine,
the risen Son of God!
Redemption by His death I find,
and cleansing through the Blood.
[3]
Love brings the glorious fullness in,
and to His saints makes known
the blessed rest from inbred sin,
through faith in Christ alone.
[4]
Believing souls, rejoicing go!
There shall to you be given
a glorious foretaste, here below,
of endless rest in heaven.
[5]
Of victory now o’er Satan’s power
let all the ransomed sing,
and triumph in the dying hour,
through Christ the Lord, our King.</Contents>

God made me for Himself, to serve Him here,
with love’s pure service and in filial fear;

then see His glory where the angels bow.

All needful grace was mine through His dear Son,
whose life and death my full salvation won;
the grace that would have strengthened me, and taught;
grace that would crown me when my work was wrought.
[3]
And I, poor sinner, cast it all away;
lived for the toil or pleasure of each day;
as if no Christ had shed His precious blood,
as if I owed no homage to my God.
[4]
O Holy Spirit, with Thy fire divine,
melt into tears this thankless heart of mine;
teach me to love what once I seemed to hate,
and live to God before it be too late.</Contents>

God moves in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform;
he plants his footsteps in the sea,
and rides upon the storm.
Deep in unfathomable mines
of never-failing skill,
he treasures up his bright designs,
and works his sov'reign will.
[2]
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
the clouds ye so much dread
are big with mercy, and shall break
in blessings on your head.
[3]
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
but trust him for his grace;
behind a frowning providence
he hides a shining face.
[4]
His purposes will ripen fast,
unfolding ev'ry hour;
the bud may have a bitter taste,
but sweet will be the flow'r.
[5]
Blind unbelief is sure to err,
and scan his work in vain;
God is his own interpreter,
and he will make it plain.</Contents>

Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways!
Fears and doubts too long have bound us;
Free our hearts to work and praise.

Heal Thy children's warring madness;
Bend our pride to Thy control;
Shame our wanton, selfish gladness,
Rich in things and poor in soul.

Lest we miss Thy kingdom's goal.

Set our feet on lofty places;
Gird our lives that they may be
Armoured with all Christlike graces
In the fight to set men free.
Grant us wisdom,
Grant us courage,
That we fail not man nor Thee.

Save us from weak resignation
To the evils we deplore;
Let the search for Thy salvation
Be our glory ever more.
Grant us wisdom,
Grant us courage,
Serving Thee whom we adore.</Contents>

Great is the gospel of our glorious God,
where mercy met the anger of God’s rod;
a penalty was paid and pardon bought,
and sinners lost at last to Him were brought:
[chorus]
O let the praises of my heart be Thine,
for Christ has died that I may call Him mine,
that I may sing with those who dwell above,
adoring, praising Jesus, King of love.
[2]
Great is the mystery of godliness,
great is the work of God’s own holiness;
it moves my soul, and causes me to long
for greater joys than to the earth belong:
[3]
The Spirit vindicated Christ our Lord,
and angels sang with joy and sweet accord;
the nations heard, a dark world flamed with light 
when Jesus rose in glory and in might:</Contents>

In the city of our God,
In the mountain of His holiness.
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth
Is Mount Zion on the sides of the north,
The city of the great King,
Is Mount Zion on the sides of the north,
The city of the great King.

One body, one Spirit, one faith, one Lord,
One people, one nation, praise ye the Lord.</Contents>

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrim through this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty,
Hold me with Thy powerful hand:
Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,
Feed me now and ever more,
Feed me now and ever more.
[2]
Open Thou the crystal fountain
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through:
Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield,
Be Thou still my strength and shield.
[3]
When I tread the verge of Jordan
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of death, and hell's destruction,
Land me safe on Canaan's side:
Songs of praises, songs of praises,
I will ever give to Thee,
I will ever give to Thee.</Contents>

Hail, Thou once despisèd Jesus,
Hail, Thou Galilean King!
Thou didst suffer to release us,
Thou didst free salvation bring.
Hail, Thou agonising Saviour,
Bearer of our sin and shame;
By Thy merits we find favour,
Life is given through Thy name.
[2]
Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
All our sins on Thee were laid.
With almighty love anointed
Thou hast full atonement made.
All Thy people are forgiven
Through the virtue of Thy blood:
Opened is the gate of heaven,
Man is reconciled to God.
[3]
Jesus, hail! enthroned in glory,
There forever to abide;
All the heavenly hosts adore Thee,
Seated at Thy Father's side:
There for sinners Thou art pleading,
There Thou dost our place prepare,
Ever for us interceding,
Till in glory we appear.
[4]
Worship, honour, power, and blessing
Thou art worthy to receive:
Loudest praises, without ceasing,
Right it is for us to give:
Come, O mighty Holy Spirit,
As our hearts and hands we raise,
Help us sing our Saviour's merits,
Help us sing Immanuel's praise.</Contents>

Hail to the Lord's anointed,
Great David's greater Son!
Hail, in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free,
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.
[2]
He comes, with succour speedy,
To those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy,
And bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for sighing,
Their darkness turn to light,
Whose souls, condemned and dying,
Were precious in His sight.
[3]
He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth;
Love, joy and hope, like flowers,
Spring in His path to birth;
Before Him, on the mountains,
Shall peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness, in fountains,
From hill to valley flow.
[4]
Kings shall fall down before Him,
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing;
To Him shall prayer unceasing
And daily vows ascend,
His kingdom still increasing,
A kingdom without end.
[5]
O'er every foe victorious,
He on His throne shall rest;
From age to age more glorious,
All-blessing and all-blessed.
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His name shall stand forever,
His changeless name of Love.</Contents>

Hallelujah! Sing to Jesus;
His the sceptre, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.
Hark, the songs of holy Zion
Thunder like a mighty flood:
'Jesus out of every nation
Hath redeemed us by His blood.'
[2]
Hallelujah! not as orphans
Are we left in sorrow now;
Hallelujah! He is near us,
Faith believes, nor questions how.
Though the clouds from sight received Him
When the forty days were o'er,
Shall our hearts forget His promise,
'I am with you ever more'?
[3]
Hallelujah! Bread of heaven,
Thou on earth our food, our stay;
Hallelujah! here the sinful
Flee to Thee from day to day.
Intercessor, Friend of sinners,
Earth's Redeemer, plead for me
Where the songs of all the sinless
Sweep across the crystal sea.
[4]
Hallelujah! sing to Jesus;
His the sceptre, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.
Hark, the songs of holy Zion
Thunder like a mighty flood:

Hath redeemed us by His blood.'</Contents>

Let every heart prepare a throne,
And every voice a song.

In Satan's bondage held;
The gates of brass before Him burst,
The iron fetters yield.

He comes the broken heart to bind,
The bleeding soul to cure,
And with the treasures of His grace
To enrich the humble poor.

Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
Thy welcome shall proclaim;
And heaven's eternal arches ring
With Thy belovèd name.</Contents>

With the angelic host proclaim,
'Christ is born in Bethlehem.'

Hark! the herald angels sing:
'Glory to the new-born King!'

Christ, by highest heaven adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord,
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin's womb.

Veiled in flesh the Godhead see!
Hail the incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with man to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel.

Hark! the herald angels sing:
'Glory to the new-born King.'

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail, the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings,

Mild, He lays His glory by;
Born that men no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth;
Born to give them second birth.

Hark! the herald angels sing:
'Glory to the new-born King.'</Contents>

Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?
Is not thine a captured heart?
Chief among ten thousand own Him,
joyful choose the better part.

Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,
lovely things of time and sense;
gilded thus does sin disarm thee,
honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.

What has stript the seeming beauty
from the idols of the earth?
Not a sense of right or duty,
but the sight of peerless worth.

Not the crushing of those idols,
with its bitter void and smart;
but the beaming of His beauty
the unveiling of His heart.

Who discards the garb of winter
till the summer has begun?

‘Tis that look that melted Peter,
‘tis that face that Stephen saw,
‘tis that heart that wept with Mary,
can alone from idols draw:

Draw and win and fill completely,
till the cup o’erflow the brim;
what have we to do with idols
who have companied with Him?</Contents>

swing your heart’s door widely open,

Room for pleasure, room for business,

Have you heard the voice of Jesus,
Softly pleading with your heart,
Have you felt His presence glorious,
As He calls your soul apart.
With a love so true and loyal,
Love divine that ever flows, 
From a saviour righteous royal,
And a crown that mercy shows.
[2]
Have you heard the voice of mercy,
Granting peace and pardon pure,
Have you felt the balm of Calvary,
Binding all your wounds secure.
Was there ever such salvation,
Was there ever care like this,
See the Saviour's grief and passion,
Grace and mercy's gentle kiss.</Contents>

His power has no boundary known unto men;
for out of His infinite riches in Jesus 
He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again!

when our strength has failed ere the day is half done,
when we reach the end of our hoarded resources,

He has led us by fire and by cloud
He will bring us to Zion to look on His face
O blessed, O blessed be God

Blessed be God, Blessed be God
Blessed, O blessed be God

He has sheltered us under His wings
And He planned every path that we've trod
To bring us to Zion, His praises to sing

    <Contents>[1]
He is not a disappointment!
Jesus is far more to me
than in all my glowing daydreams
I had fancied He could be;
and the more I get to know Him,
so the more I find Him true,
and the more I long that others
should be led to know Him too.
[2]
He is not a disappointment!
He has saved my soul from sin;
all the guilt and all the anguish
which oppressed my heart within
He has banished by His presence,
and His blessed kiss of peace
has assured my heart for ever
that His love will never cease.
[3]
He is not a disappointment!
He has sanctified my soul,
cleansed me from my heart corruption,
purified and made me whole;
He removed the sinward proneness,
stamped His image in its place,
for He won me by the beauty
and unveiling of His face.
[4]
He is not a disappointment!
He is all in all to me,
Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer;
the unchanging Christ is He!
He has won my heart’s affections,
and He meets my every need;
He is not a disappointment,
for He satisfies indeed.

And we know he is coming back again
in pow'r and glory.
He is coming back again
to claim his people;
he is coming back again
to bring his children home with him,
home with him.

He is the One who gave
his life for all the world,
he is the Lord of lords,
who rose up from the grave,
defeated death and hell;
he is the Lord of lords.

He's coming in the clouds
and every eye shall see

then every knee shall bow

He leadeth me! O blessed thought,
O words with heavenly comfort fraught;
whate’er I do, where’er I be,

He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
for by His hand He leadeth me.

Sometimes ‘mid scenes of deepest gloom,
sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,
by waters still, o’er troubled sea,
still ‘tis His hand that leadeth me.
[3]
Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
nor ever murmur or repine;
content, whatever lot I see,
since ‘tis my God that leadeth me.
[4]
And when my task on earth is done,
when, by Thy grace, the victory’s won,
e’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
since Thou through Jordan leadest me.</Contents>

He that doth in the secret place
of the Most High reside,
under the shade of Him that is
the Almighty shall abide.
[2]
I of the Lord my God will say,
He is my refuge still,
He is my fortress and my God,
and in Him trust I will.
[3]
Assuredly He shall thee save,
and give deliverance
both from the fowler’s snare, and from
the noisome pestilence.
[4]
His feathers shall thee hide; thy trust
under His wings shall be:
His faithfulness shall be a shield
and buckler unto thee.
[5]
Thou shalt not need to be afraid
for terrors of the night;
nor for the arrow that doth fly
by day, while it is light;
[6]
Nor for the pestilence, that walks
in darkness secretly;
nor for destruction that doth waste
at noon-day openly.
[7]
Because on me He set His love,
deliver him will I;
because my great name he hath known,
I will him set on high.
[8]
He’ll call on me, I’ll answer him;
I will be with him still
in trouble, to deliver him,
and honour him I will.</Contents>

He who would valiant be
'Gainst all disaster,
Let him in constancy
Follow the Master.
There's no discouragement
Shall make him once relent
His first avowed intent
To be a pilgrim.

Who so beset him round
With dismal stories,
Do but themselves confound-
His strength the more is.
No foes shall stay his might,
Though he with giants fight;
He will make good his right
To be a pilgrim.
[3]
Since, Lord, Thou dost defend
Us with Thy Spirit,
We know we at the end
Shall life inherit.
Then fancies flee away!
I'll fear not what men say,
I'll labour night and day
To be a pilgrim.</Contents>

Hear the Lord of harvest sweetly calling,
“Who will go and work for Me to-day?
Who will bring to Me the lost and dying?
Who will point them to the narrow
way?”
[chorus]
Speak, my Lord, speak to me,
Speak, and I'll be quick to answer Thee;
Speak, my Lord, speak to me,
Speak, and I will answer, “Lord, send me.”
[2]
When the coal of fire touched the prophet,
making him as pure, as pure can be,
when the voice of God said, “Who'll go for us?”
then he answered, “Here I am, send me.”
[3]
Millions now in sin and shame are dying; 
listen to their sad and bitter cry;
hasten, brother, hasten to the rescue;
quickly answer, “Master, here am I.”
[4]
Soon the time for reaping will be over;
soon we'll gather for the harvest-home;
may the Lord of harvest smile upon us,
may we hear His blessed, “Child, well done!”</Contents>

Help me to love, as Jesus loved,

Help me to seek, as Jesus sought,

kept in His fellowship divine,

Fountains opened deep and wide;
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above,
And heaven's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.</Contents>

I will soar with You above the storm
Father you are king over the flood

His hands were pierced, 
The hands that made 
The mountain range and everglade; 
That washed the stains of sin away 
And changed earth's darkness into day.
[2]
His feet were pierced, 
The feet that trod 
The furthest shining star of God; 
And left their imprint deep and clear 
On ev'ry winding pathway here.
[3]
His heart was pierced, 
The heart that burned 
To comfort every heart that yearned, 
And from it came a cleansing flood, 
The river of redeeming blood.
[4]
His hands and feet 
And heart, all three 
Were pierced for me on Calvary, 
And here and now to him I bring 
My hands, feet, heart, an offering.</Contents>

in glory that excel.

Ho, every one that is thirsty in spirit,
ho, every one that is weary and sad;
come to the fountain, there’s fullness in Jesus,
all that you’re longing for, come and be glad.
[chorus]
“I will pour water on him that is thirsty,
I will pour floods upon the dry ground;
open your heart for the gift I am bringing;
while ye are seeking Me, I will be found.”
[2]
Child of the world, are you tired of your bondage?
weary of earth-joys, so false, so untrue?
thirsting for God and His fullness of blessing?
List to the promise, a message for you!
[3]
Child of the Kingdom, be filled with the Spirit!
Nothing but fullness thy longing can meet:
‘tis the enduement for life and for service;
Thine is the promise, so certain, so sweet.</Contents>

Who were, and are, and ever more shall be.

Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power, in love and purity.

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name
In earth, and sky, and sea;
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,

How firm a foundation,
you saints of the Lord,
is laid for your faith
in his excellent word;
what more can he say
than to you he has said,
you who unto Jesus
for refuge have fled?
[2]
Fear not, I am with you,
O be not dismayed;
for I am your God,
and will still give you aid;
I'll strengthen you, help you,
and cause you to stand,
upheld by my righteous,
omnipotent hand.
[3]
In every condition,
in sickness, in health,
in poverty's vale,
or abounding in wealth;
at home and abroad,
on the land, on the sea,
as your days may demand
shall your strength ever be.
[4]
When through the deep waters
I call you to go,
the rivers of grief
shall not you overflow;
for I will be with you
in trouble to bless,
and sanctify to you
your deepest distress.
[5]
When through fiery trials
your pathway shall lie,
my grace all-sufficient
shall be your supply;
the flame shall not hurt you,
my only design
your dross to consume
and your gold to refine.
[6]
The soul that on Jesus
has leaned for repose
I will not, I cannot,
desert to its foes;
that soul, though all hell
should endeavour to shake,
I never will leave,
I will never forsake.</Contents>

Channels only, blessed Master,

flowing through us, Thou canst use us

Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me, 
a clean vessel in Thine hand, 
with no power but as Thou givest,
graciously, with each command.

Witnessing Thy power to save me,
setting free from self and sin;
Thou who boughtest me to possess me,
in Thy fullness, Lord, come in.

Just a channel full of blessing, 
to the thirsty hearts around;
to tell out Thy full salvation,
all Thy loving message sound.

Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit
hearts that full surrender know,
that the streams of living water
from our inner man may flow.</Contents>

My soul longs and yearns for Your courts,
And my heart and flesh sing for joy
To the living God.

One day in Your presence
Is far better to me than gold,
Or to live my whole life somewhere else;
And I would rather be
A doorkeeper in Your house

Than to take my fate upon myself.
You are my sun and my shield,
You are my lover from the start,
And the highway to Your city
Runs through my heart.</Contents>

How lovely is Thy dwelling-place,
O Lord of hosts, to me!
The tabernacles of Thy grace
How pleasant, Lord, they be!
[2]
My thirsty soul longs vehemently,
Yea faints, Thy courts to see:
My very heart and flesh cry out,
O living God, for Thee.
[3]
Behold, the sparrow findeth out
An house wherein to rest;
the swallow also for herself
hath purchased a nest;
[4]
E’en Thine own altars, where she safe
her young ones forth may bring,
O Thou almighty Lord of hosts,
who art my God and King.
[5]
Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,
they ever give Thee praise.
Blest is the man whose strength Thou art,
in whose heart are Thy ways.
[6]
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
the God whom we adore,
be glory, as it was, and is,
and shall be evermore.  Amen.</Contents>

How shall they hear, who have not heard
news of a Lord who loved and came?
nor known His reconciling word,
nor learned to trust the Saviour's name?
[2]
To all the world, to every place,
neighbours and friends and far-off lands,
preach the good news of saving grace;
go while the great commission stands.
[3]
“Whom shall I send?” Who hears the
call,
constant in prayer, through toil and pain,
telling of one who died for all,
to bring a lost world home again?
[4]
“Lord, here am I,” Your fire impart
to this poor cold self-centred soul;
touch but my lips, my hands, my heart,
and make a world for Christ my goal.
[5]
Spirit of love, within us move:
Spirit of truth, in power come down!
So shall they hear and find and prove
Christ is their life, their joy, their crown.</Contents>

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary, rest.
[2]
Dear name, the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place,
My never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace!
Jesus! My Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest and King,
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.
[3]
Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I'll praise Thee as I ought.
Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
And may the music of Thy name
Refresh my soul in death.</Contents>

Child in the manger, infant of Mary,

Child who inherits all out transgressions,
all our demerits on Him fall.

Once the most holy child of salvation
gentle and lowly lived below:
now as our glorious mighty Redeemer,
see Him victorious over each foe.

angels behold Him on His throne:
worthy our Saviour of all their praises;
happy for ever are His own.</Contents>

binding all the Church in one,
holy Zion's help for ever,
and her confidence alone.

To this temple, where we call you,
come, O Lord of hosts, today;
you have promised loving kindness,
hear your servants as we pray,
bless your people now before you,
turn our darkness into day.

Hear the cry of all your people,
what they ask and hope to gain;
what they gain from you, for ever
with your chosen to retain,
and hereafter in your glory
evermore with you to reign.

Praise and honour to the Father,
praise and honour to the Son,
praise and honour to the Spirit,
ever Three and ever One,
One in might and One in glory,

Christ is risen! hallelujah!
risen our victorious Head;
sing His praises; hallelujah!
Christ is risen from the dead.
Gratefully our hearts adore Him,
as His light once more appears;
bowing down in joy before Him,
rising up from grief and tears.
[chorus]
Christ is risen! hallelujah!
risen our victorious Head;
sing His praises; hallelujah!
Christ is risen from the dead.
[2]
Christ is risen! all the sadness
of His earthly life is o’er;
through the open gates of gladness
He returns to life once more.
Death and hell before Him bending,
He doth rise the Victor now,
angels on His steps attending,
glory round His wounded brow.
[3]
Christ is risen! henceforth never
death or hell shall us enthral;
we are Christ’s, in Him for ever
we have triumphed over all;
all the doubting and dejection
of our trembling hearts have ceased.
‘Tis His day of resurrection;
let us rise and keep the feast.</Contents>

how we too may enter heaven:

Triumph o'er the shades of night:

Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by Thee;
Joyless is the day's return,
Till Thy mercy's beams I see;
Till they inward light impart,
Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.

Visit then this soul of mine;
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
Fill me, radiancy divine;
Scatter all my unbelief;
More and more Thyself display,
Shining to the perfect day.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Christians awake! Salute the happy morn,
Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born;
Rise to adore the mystery of love
Which hosts of angels chanted from above;
With them the joyful tidings first begun
Of God Incarnate and the Virgin's Son.
[2]
Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
Who heard the angelic herald's voice 'Behold,
I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth
To you and all the nations upon earth:
This day hath God fulfilled His promised word,
This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.'
[3]
He spake; and straightway the celestial choir
In hymns of joy unknown before conspire;
High praise of God's redeeming love they sang,
And heaven's whole orb with hallelujahs rang;
God's highest glory was their anthem still,
'On earth be peace, and unto men goodwill.'
[4]
O may we keep and ponder in our mind
God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind;
Trace we the Babe who hath retrieved our loss,
From His poor manger to His bitter cross;
Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,
Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.
[5]
Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphant song:
He that was born upon this joyful day
Around us all His glory shall display;
Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
Eternal praise to heaven's almighty King.</Contents>

Church of God, beloved and chosen,
church of God for whom Christ died,
claim thy gifts and praise the Giver!
Ye are washed and sanctified!
Sanctified by God the Father,
and by Jesus Christ His Son,
and by God the Holy Spirit,
holy, holy, Three in One.
[2]
By His will He sanctifieth,
by the Spirit’s power within;
by the loving hand that chasteneth,
fruits of righteousness to win;
by His truth, and by His promise,
by His Word, His gift unpriced,
by His blood, and by our union
With the risen life of Christ.
[3]
Holiness by faith in Jesus.
Not by effort of thine own,
sin’s dominion crushed and broken,
by the power of grace alone;
God’s own holiness within thee,
His own beauty on thy brow,
this shall be thy pilgrim brightness,
this thy blessed portion now.
[4]
He will sanctify thee wholly;
body, spirit, soul shall be
blameless till thy Saviour’s coming
in His glorious majesty:
He hath perfected for ever
those whom He hath sanctified;
spotless, glorious and holy
is the Church, His chosen Bride.</Contents>

I am coming to the cross,

I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
blessed Lamb of Calvary;
humbly at Thy cross I bow:
Jesus saves me, saves me now.

Long my heart has sighed for Thee,
long has evil reigned within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me:
“I will cleanse you from all sin.”

Here I give my all to Thee,
friends and time and earthly store,
soul and body, Thine to be,
wholly Thine for evermore.

In the promises I trust,
now I know the blood applied;
I am prostrate in the dust,
I with Christ am crucified.

Jesus comes! He fills my soul!
Perfected in Him I am:
I am every whit made whole:
Glory, glory to the Lamb!</Contents>

I am not skilled to understand
what God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand
stands One who is my Saviour.
[2]
I take Him at His word indeed;
“Christ died for sinners,” this I read;
for in my heart I find a need
of Him to be my Saviour.
[3]
That He should leave His place on high, 
and come for sinful man to die,
you count it strange? so once did I
before I knew my Saviour!
[4]
And oh, that He fulfilled may see
the travail of His soul in me,
and with His work contented be,
as I with my dear Saviour!
[5]
Yea, living, dying, let me bring
my strength, my solace, from this spring,
that He who lives to be my King
once died to be my Saviour.</Contents>

I’ll sing it o’er and o’er;
I am redeemed! oh, praise the Lord!
Redeemed for ever more!
[2]
I looked, and lo, from Calvary’s cross
a healing fountain streamed;
it cleansed my heart, and now I sing,
praise God, I am redeemed!
[3]
The debt is paid, my soul is free;
and by His mighty power,
the blood that washed my sins away
still cleanseth every hour.
[4]
All glory be to Jesus’ name!
I know that He is mine!
For on my heart the Spirit seals
His pledge of love Divine.
[5]
And when I reach that world more bright
than mortal ever dreamed,
I’ll cast my crown at Jesus’ feet
and cry, “Redeemed, redeemed!”</Contents>

I am so glad that our Father in heaven
tells of His love in the Book He has given:
wonderful things in the Bible I see:
this is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.
[chorus]
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me.
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.
[2]
Jesus loves me and I know I love Him;
love brought Him down my lost soul to redeem,
yes, it was love made Him die on the tree;
oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!
[3]
In this assurance I find sweetest rest,
trusting in Jesus I know I am blest;
Satan, dismayed, from my soul now doth flee,
when I just tell him that Jesus loves me.
[4]
Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,
when in His beauty I see the great King,
this shall my song in eternity be,
“Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!”</Contents>

To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,

Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,

That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,

There are heights of joy that I may not reach

As I walk, let me walk, close with thee.

Just a closer walk with thee;
Grant it, Jesus, this my plea.
Daily walking close with thee;
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Through the world of toils and snares;
If I flatter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me, my burden shares?
None but thee, dear Lord, none but thee.

When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me will be no more.
Guide me gently, safely home,
To thy kingdom's shore, to thy shore.</Contents>

I bind unto myself today
the strong name of the Trinity,
by invocation of the same,
the Three in One and One in Three.
[2]
I bind this day to me for ever,
by pow'r of faith, Christ's incarnation,
his baptism in the Jordan river,
his death on cross for my salvation;
his bursting from the spicèd tomb,
his riding up the heav'nly way,
his coming at the day of doom,
I bind unto myself today.
[3]
I bind unto myself the pow'r
of the great love of cherubim;
the sweet 'Well done!' in judgement hour;
the service of the seraphim,
confessors' faith, apostles' word,
the patriarchs' prayers, the prophets' scrolls,
all good deeds done unto the Lord,
and purity of faithful souls.
[4]
PART TWO
[5]
Christ be with me, Christ within me,
Christ behind me, Christ before me,
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,
Christ to comfort and restore me.
Christ beneath me, Christ above me,
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,
Christ in hearts of all that love me,
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.
[6]
DOXOLOGY
[7]
I bind unto myself the name,
the strong name of the Trinity,
by invocation of the same,
the Three in One and One in Three,
of whom all nature hath creation,
eternal Father, Spirit, Word.
Praise to the Lord of my salvation:
salvation is of Christ the Lord.
Amen.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
I cannot tell why He, whom angels worship,
Should set His love upon the sons of men,
Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wanderers,
To bring them back, they know not how or when.

But this I know, that He was born of Mary,
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home,
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured,
And so the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is come.
[2]
I cannot tell how silently He suffered,
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,
Or how His heart upon the cross wasbroken,
The crown of pain to three-and-thirty years.

But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,
And stays our sin, and calms our lurkingfear,
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden,
For yet the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is here.
[3]
I cannot tell how He will win the nations,
How He will claim His earthly heritage,
How satisfy the needs and aspirations
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.

But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,
And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendour,
When He the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is known.
[4]
I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,
When, at his bidding, every storm is stilled,
Or who can say how great the jubilation
When all the hearts of men with love are filled.

But this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,
And myriad, myriad human voices sing,
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:
'At last the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is King!'</Contents>

I come, my God, for cleansing, free
from sin’s defiling stains,
I see, oh God, I weep to see
the sinfulness corrupting me
which in my heart remains.

I hate my envy and my pride,
my failure and my sin,
to think that all these things could hide
within, where blood had been applied,
and stay concealed therein.
[3]
Oh, let me not side-step the cross
in this my crisis hour,
excuse so subtly selfish dross,
and gain my life when death seems loss,
and miss Your path, Your power.
[4]
I come, Lord Jesus, hear my cry,
oh cleanse my heart today,
I come to Calvary to die,
and with your death identify,
this is the only way.
[5]
I come, I trust, and now I see
the power of Jesus’ blood;
grace channels in His purity,
and in Him I find liberty
and rest and joy in God.</Contents>

you paid the greatest price,

He’ll show the way to me:

I know who holds the future,
and He’ll guide me with His hand;
with God things don’t just happen,
everything by Him is planned.
So as I face tomorrow,
with its problems large and small,
I’ll trust the God of miracles,
give to Him my all.

I do not know how many days
of life are mine to spend;
but One who knows and cares for me
will keep me to the end:
[3]
I do not know the course ahead,
what joys and griefs are there;
but One is near who fully knows,
I’ll trust His loving care:</Contents>

I have a Friend so precious,
so very dear to me,
He loves me with such tender love,
He loves so faithfully;
I could not live apart from Him,
I love to feel Him nigh,
and so we dwell together,
my Lord and I.
[2]
He knows how much I love Him,
He knows I love Him well;
but with what love He loveth me
my tongue can never tell;
it is an everlasting love,
in ever rich supply,
and so we love each other,
my Lord and I.
[3]
He knows how I am longing
some weary soul to win,
and so He bids me go and speak
the loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
and why He came to die,
and so we work together,
my Lord and I.
[4]
So up into the mountains
of heaven’s cloudless light,
or away into the valleys
of darkness or of night.
Though round us tempests gather
and storms are raging high,
we’ll travel on together,
my Lord and I.
[5]
And when the journey’s ended,
in rest and peace at last,
when every thought of danger
and weariness is past,
in the Kingdom of the future,
in the glory by and by,
we’ll live and reign together,
my Lord and I.</Contents>

I have a precious Book, it's the Word of God.
It's the only Book that God has giv'n.
As I read, God speaks to me,
I see Christ and Calvary.
The Wonderful Word of God.

Forever it will stand as the ages roll,
It's the living and eternal Word.
It's my guiding light each day,
and without it I would stray;
The Wonderful Word of God.

Dear Lord may I each day read Thy precious Word.
May I love it and obey it too. 
May I grow to be like Thee.
May my friends see Christ in me.
In Jesus' Name, Amen.</Contents>

I have a Shepherd, One I love so well;
how He has blessed me tongue can never tell;
on the Cross He suffered, shed His blood and died,
that I might ever in His love confide.
[chorus]
Following Jesus, ever day by day,
nothing can harm me when He leads the way;
darkness or sunshine, whate’er befall,
Jesus, the Shepherd, is my All in All.
[2]
Pastures abundant doth His hand provide,
still waters flowing ever at my side,
goodness and mercy follow on my track,
with such a Shepherd nothing can I lack.
[3]
When I would wander from the path astray,
then He will draw me back into the way;
in the darkest valley I need fear no ill,
for He, my Shepherd, will be with me still.
[4]
When labour’s ended and the journey done,
then He will lead me safely to my home;
there I shall dwell in rapture sure and sweet,
with all the loved ones gathered round His feet.</Contents>

I love the Christ that died on Calvary,
for He washed my sins away;
He put within my heart a melody,

I have one deep, supreme desire,
that I may be like Jesus.
To this I fervently aspire,
that I may be like Jesus.
I want my heart His throne to be,
so that a watching world may see
His likeness shining forth in me.
I want to be like Jesus.
[2]
He spent His life in doing good;
I want to be like Jesus.
In lowly paths of service trod;
I want to be like Jesus.
He sympathised with hearts distressed,
He spoke the words that cheered and blessed,
He welcomed sinners to His breast.
I want to be like Jesus.
[3]
A holy, harmless life He led;
I want to be like Jesus.
The Father’s will, His drink and bread;
I want to be like Jesus.
And when at last He comes to die,
“Forgive them, Father,” hear Him cry
for those who taunt and crucify.
I want to be like Jesus.
[4]
O perfect life of Christ, my Lord!
I want to be like Jesus.
My recompense and my reward,
that I may be like Jesus.
His Spirit fill my hungering soul,
His power all my life control.
My deepest prayer, my highest goal,
that I may be like Jesus.</Contents>

I hear angels singing praises,
I see men from every nation,
Bowing down - before the throne.
Like the sound of many waters,
Like a rushing wind around us,
Multitudes - join the song.

And a symphony of praise arises;
Tears are wiped away from eyes,
As men from ev'ry tongue and tribe,
All sing……
[chorus]
Holy Holy, God Almighty, who was,
Who is and is to come;
All the angels are crying 'Holy',
To the Lamb who sits upon the throne.
Holy Holy, God Almighty, who was,
Who is and is to come;
All creation is bringing glory,
To the Lamb who sits upon the throne.
[2]
I see one who's full of wonder,
Eyes of fire and voice of thunder,
Shining bright - His majesty.
All the colours of the rainbow,
Circles Him - and fill - His temple,
So beautiful - this is to me.

And a symphony of praise arises;
Tears are wiped away from eyes,
As men from ev'ry tongue and tribe,
All sing……</Contents>

All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail, the gift of Christ our Lord,

I heard an old, old story,
how a Saviour came from glory,
how He gave His life on Calvary
to save a wretch like me.
I heard about His groaning,
of His precious blood's atoning.
Then I repented of my sins and won
the victory.
[chorus]
Oh, victory in Jesus, my Saviour,
forever!
He sought me and bought me with 
His redeeming blood.
He loved me ere I knew Him, 
and all my love is due Him.
He plunged me to victory beneath
the cleansing flood.
[2]
I heard about His healing,
of His cleansing power revealing,
how He made the lame to walk again
and caused the blind to see.
And then I cried, “Dear Jesus,
come and heal my broken spirit”;
and somehow Jesus came and brought
to me the victory.
[3]
I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
and I heard about the streets of gold
beyond the crystal sea;
about the angels singing,
and the old redemption story.
And some sweet day I'll sing up there 
the song of victory.</Contents>

I heard the voice of Jesus say:
'Come unto Me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast.'
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary and worn and sad;
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.
[2]
I heard the voice of Jesus say:
'Behold I freely give
The living water, thirsty one,
Stoop down and drink and live.'
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.
[3]
I heard the voice of Jesus say:
'I am this dark world's light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright.'
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that light of life I'll walk,
Till travelling days are done.</Contents>

To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day.

Wrought peace within my heart.

Of weary ways or golden days
Before His face I see.

Or 'meet Him in the air'.</Contents>

I don't borrow from it's sunshine,
For it's skies may turn to gray.

For I know what Jesus said,
And today I'll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.

Many things about tomorrow,
I don't seem to understand;
But I know Who holds tomorrow,
And I know Who holds my hand.

Ev'ry step is getting brighter,
As the golden stairs I climb;
Ev'ry burden's getting lighter;
Ev'ry cloud is silver lined.
There the sun is always shining,
There no tear will dim the eyes,
At the ending of the rainbow,
Where the mountains touch the sky.
[3]
I don't know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the One Who feeds the sparrow,
Is the One Who stands by me.
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood,
But His presence goes before me,
And I'm covered with His blood. </Contents>

I lay my sins on Jesus,
the spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us
from the accursed load.
I bring my guilt to Jesus,
to wash my crimson stains
white in His blood most precious,
till not a spot remains.
[2]
I lay my wants on Jesus,
all fullness dwells in Him:
He heals all my diseases,
He doth my soul redeem.
I lay my griefs on Jesus,
my burdens and my cares;
He from them all releases;
He all my sorrows shares.
[3]
I rest my soul on Jesus,
this weary soul of mine;
His right hand me embraces,
I on His breast recline.
I love the name of Jesus,
Immanuel, Christ, the Lord:
like fragrance on the breezes,
His name abroad is poured.
[4]
I long to be like Jesus,
meek, loving, lowly, mild;
I long to be like Jesus,
the Father’s holy child.
I long to be with Jesus
amid the heavenly throng,
to sing with saints His praises,
to learn the angels’ song.</Contents>

I lift my heart to Thee,
Saviour divine;
for Thou art all to me,

Is there on earth a closer bond than this,
that my Beloved's mine, and I am His?

Thine am I by all ties;
but chiefly Thine,
that through Thy sacrifice
Thou, Lord, art mine.
By Thine own cords of love so sweetly
wound
around me, I to Thee am closely bound.

To Thee, Thou bleeding Lamb,
I all things owe;
all that I have and am,
and all I know.
All that I have is now no longer mine,
and I am not my own; Lord, I am Thine.

How can I, Lord, withhold
life's brightest hour
from Thee, or gathered gold,
or any power?
Why should I keep one precious thing 
from Thee,
when Thou hast given Thine own dear
Self for me?</Contents>

I love to hear the story
which angel voices tell,
how once the King of Glory
came down to earth to dwell;
I am both weak and sinful,
but this I surely know,
the Lord came down to save me,
because He loved me so.
[2]
I’m glad my blessed Saviour
was once a child like me,
to show how pure and holy
His little ones might be;
and if I try to follow
His footsteps here below,
He never will forget me,
because He loved me so.
[3]
To sing His love and mercy,
my sweetest songs I’ll raise,
and though I cannot see Him,
I know He hears my praise!
For He has kindly promised
that I shall surely go
to sing among His angels,
because He loved me so.</Contents>

I love to tell the story
of unseen things above,
of Jesus and his glory,
of Jesus and his love.
I love to tell the story,
because I know it's true;
it satisfies my longings
as nothing else can do.
[chorus]
I love to tell the story,
'twill be my theme in glory,
to tell the old, old story
of Jesus and his love.
[2]
I love to tell the story:
more wonderful it seems
than all the golden fancies
of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story:
it did so much for me;
and that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee.
[3]
I love to tell the story:
'tis pleasant to repeat
what seems, each time I tell it,
more wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story,
for some have never heard
the message of salvation
from God's own holy word.
[4]
I love to tell the story:
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting
to hear it, like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the new, new song,
'twill be the old, old story
that I have loved so long.</Contents>

Though the fears of death surround me
I won't be afraid if you are there.
When I call your name you hear me,
when I am brought low I find you near.
It is to you I lift up my eyes, only you.
[2]
What can I give for all you've done for me so freely?
I will make known your overwhelming love that rescued me.
I'll complete all I have promised
in the presence of your people here,
calling on your name for ever,
living always in your house of prayer.
It is to you I lift up my eyes, only you.
It is to you I lift up my eyes, only you.</Contents>

I must have the Saviour with me
for I dare not walk alone,
I must feel His presence near me,
and His arm around me thrown.
[chorus]
Then my soul shall fear no ill,
let Him lead me where He will,
I will go without a murmur,
and His footsteps follow still.
[2]
I must have the Saviour with me
for my faith at best is weak;
He can whisper words of comfort,
that no other voice can speak.
[3]
I must have the Saviour with me
in the onward march of life,
through the tempest and the sunshine,
through the battle and the strife.
[4]
I must have the Saviour with me,
and His eye the way must guide,
till I reach the vale of Jordan,
till I cross the rolling tide.</Contents>

I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
there’s no other way but this;
I shall ne’er get sight of the Gates of Light,
if the way of the cross I miss.
[chorus]
The way of the cross leads home,
the way of the cross leads home,
it is sweet to know, as I onward go,
the way of the cross leads home.
[2]
I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way.
The path that the Saviour trod,
if I ever climb to the heights sublime,
where the soul is at home with God.
[3]
Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,
to walk in it never more;
for my Lord says “Come,” and I seek my home,
where He waits at the open door.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
I once was a stranger 
to grace and to God,
I knew not my danger
and felt not my load;
though friends spoke in rapture
of Christ on the tree,
Jehovah Tsidkenu
was nothing to me.
[2]
Like tears from the daughters
of Zion that roll,
I wept when the waters
went over His soul;
yet thought not that my sins
had nailed to the tree
Jehovah Tsidkenu;
‘twas nothing to me.
[3]
When free grace awoke me
by light from on high,
then legal fears shook me,
I trembled to die;
no refuge, no safety
in self could I see,
Jehovah Tsidkenu
my Saviour must be.
[4]
My terrors all vanished
before the sweet name,
my guilty fears banished,
with boldness I came
to drink at the fountain,
life-giving and free,
Jehovah Tsidkenu
is all things to me.
[5]
E’en treading the valley,
the shadow of death,
this watchword shall rally
my faltering breath;
for when from life’s fever
my God sets me free,
Jehovah Tsidkenu
my deathsong shall be.</Contents>

I saw a new vision of Jesus,
a view I’d not seen here before,
beholding in glory so wondrous
with beauty I had to adore.
I stood on the shores of my weakness,
and gazed at the brink of such fear;
‘twas then that I saw Him in newness,
regarding Him fair and so dear.
[2]
My Saviour will never forsake me,
unveiling His merciful face,
His presence and promise almighty,
redeeming His loved ones by grace.
In shades of the valley’s dark terror,
where hell and its horror hold sway,
my Jesus will reach out in power,
and save me by His only way.
[3]
For yonder a light shines eternal,
which spreads through the valley of gloom;
Lord Jesus, resplendent and regal,
drives fear far away from the tomb.
Our God is the end of the journey,
His pleasant and glorious domain;
for there are the children of mercy,
who praise Him for Calvary’s pain.</Contents>

I stood one day at Calvary
where Jesus bled and died,
I never knew He loved me so,
for me was crucified;
and as I stood there in my sin,
His love reached down to me,
and O the shame that filled my soul
that day at Calvary!
[2]
I knelt one day at Calvary;
my eyes were filled with tears
to think such love I had refused
through all these wasted years;
and as I knelt I heard Him say,
“I did it all for thee,”
and O the love that filled my soul
that day at Calvary!
[3]
I prayed one day at Calvary,
“I’m Thine for evermore!
Forgive me, Lord, for all my sin;
my lost estate restore!”
And as I prayed, to me He gave
salvation full and free,
and O the peace that filled my soul
that day at Calvary!</Contents>

I think when, when I read that sweet story of old,
when Jesus was here among men,
how He called little children as lambs to His fold,
I should like to have been with Him then.
I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,
That His arms had been thrown around me,
and that I might have seen His kind look when He said,
“Let little children come unto Me.”
[2]
Yet still to His footstool in prayer I may go,
and ask for a share of His love;
and, if I now earnestly seek Him below,
I shall see Him and hear Him
in that beautiful place He has gone to prepare
for all who are washed and forgiven;
and many dear children are gathering there,
for of such is the kingdom of  heaven.
[3]
But thousands and thousands who wander and fall
never heard of that heavenly home;
I should like them to know there is room for them all,
and that Jesus has bid them to come.
I long for  the joy of that glorious day,
the fairest and brightest and best,
when the dear little children of every cline, 
shall crowd to His arms and be blest.</Contents>

I thirst, Thou wounded Lamb of God,
to wash me in Thy cleansing blood;
to dwell within Thy wounds; then pain
is sweet, and life or death is gain.
[2]
Take my poor heart, and let it be
for ever closed to all but Thee;
seal Thou my breast, and let me wear
that pledge of love for ever there.
[3]
How blest are they who still abide
close sheltered in Thy bleeding side!
Who life and strength from thence derive,
and by Thee move, and in Thee live.
[4]
What are our works but sin and death,
till Thou Thy quickening Spirit breathe?
Thou givest the power, Thy grace doth move:
O wondrous grace! O boundless love!
[5]
Ah, Lord, enlarge our scanty thought
to know the wonders Thou hast wrought;
unloose our stammering tongues to tell
Thy love immense, unsearchable.</Contents>

I to the hills will lift mine eyes,
from whence doth come mine aid?
My safety cometh from the Lord,
who heaven and earth hath made.
[2]
Thy foot he’ll not let slide, nor will
He slumber that thee keeps.
Behold, he that keeps Israel,
He slumbers not, nor sleeps.
[3]
The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade
on thy right hand doth stay:
the moon by night thee shall not smite,
nor yet the sun by day.
[4]
The Lord shall keep thy soul; he shall
preserve thee from all ill.
Henceforth thy going out and in
God keep for ever will.
[5]
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
the God whom we adore,
be glory, as it was, and is,
and shall be evermore.  Amen.</Contents>

I waited for the Lord my God,
and patiently did bear;
at length to me He did incline
my voice and cry to hear.
[2]
He took me from a fearful pit,
and from the miry clay,
and on a rock He set my feet,
establishing my way.
[3]
He put a new song in my mouth, 
our God to magnify:
many shall see it, and shall fear,
and on the Lord rely.
[4]
O blessed is the man whose trust
upon the Lord relies;
respecting not the proud, nor such
as turn aside to lies.
[5]
O Lord my God, full many are
the wonders Thou hast done;
Thy gracious thoughts to us-ward are
above all thoughts are gone.
[6]
None can they reckon, unto Thee:
if I would them declare.
If I would speak of them, they more
than can be numbered, are.
[7]
To Father, Son and Holy Ghost
the God whom we adore
be glory as it was, is now
and shall be evermore.</Contents>

I want, dear Lord, a heart that’s true and clean;
a sunlit heart, with not a cloud between;
a heart like Thine,  a heart divine, a heart as white as snow;

I want, dear Lord, a soul on fire for Thee;
a soul baptised with heavenly energy,
a willing mind, a ready hand, to do whate’er I know,
to spread Thy light wherever I may go.

I want, dear Lord, a faith that looks to Thee
to cheer the way when naught but clouds I see;
a faith sublime, a faith divine, a faith that will not fail
to trust in Thee and over sin prevail.
[5]
I want, dear Lord, a hope steadfast and sure,
a hope that holds to things that will endure;
a hope in heaven, a hope in Thee, a hope that’s bright and clear,
dispelling doubt and conquering every fear.</Contents>

I was journeying in the noontide,
when His light shone o’er my road
and I saw Him in that glory,
saw Him, Jesus, Son of God.
All around, in noonday splendour,
earthly scenes lay fair and bright;
but my eyes no longer see them
for the glory of that light.
[chorus]
I have seen the face of Jesus,
tell me not of aught beside;
I have heard the voice of Jesus,
all my soul is satisfied.
[2]
Others, in the summer sunshine,
wearily may journey on;
I have seen a light from heaven,
past the brightness of the sun;
light that knows no cloud, no waning,
light wherein I see His face,
all His love’s uncounted treasures,
all the riches of His grace.
[3]
Marvel not that Christ in glory
all my inmost heart hath won;
not a star to cheer my darkness,
but a light beyond the sun.
All below lies dark and shadowed,
nothing there to claim my heart,
save the lonely track of sorrow
where of old He walked apart.
[4]
Sinners, it was not to angels
all this wondrous love was given,
but to one who scorned, despised Him,
scorned and hated Christ in heaven.
From the lowest depths of evil,
to the throne in heaven above,
thus in me He told the measure
of His free unbounded love.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
I was once far away from the Saviour
and as vile as a sinner could be;
and I wondered if Christ the Redeemer
could save a poor sinner like me.
[2]
I wandered on in the darkness,
not a ray of light could I see;
and the thought filled my heart with
sadness,
there’s no hope for a sinner like me.
[3]
And then, in that dark lonely hour,
a voice sweetly whispered to me,
saying, “Christ the Redeemer has power
to save a poor sinner like thee.”
[4]
I listened: and lo! ‘twas the Saviour
that was speaking so kindly to me;
I cried, “I’m the chief of sinners,
Thou canst save a poor sinner like me!”
[5]
I then fully trusted in Jesus;
and oh, what a joy came to me!
My heart was filled with His praises
for saving a sinner like me.
[6]
No longer in darkness I’m walking,
for the light is now shining on me,
and now unto others I’m telling
how He saved a poor sinner like me.
[7]
And when life’s journey is over,
and I the dear Saviour shall see,
I’ll praise Him for ever and ever,for saving a sinner like me.</Contents>

I was sinking deep in sin,
sinking to rise no more,
overwhelmed by guilt within,
mercy I did implore.
Then the Master of the sea
heard my despairing cry,
Christ my Saviour lifted me,
now safe am I.
[chorus]
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When no one but Christ could help,
love lifted me!
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When no one but Christ could help,
love lifted me!
[2]
Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love
out of the angry waves.
He’s the Master of the sea,
billows His will obey;
He your Saviour wants to be,
be saved today!
[3]
When the waves of sorrow roll,
when I am in distress,
Jesus takes my hand in His,
ever He loves to bless.
He will every fear dispel,
satisfy every need;
all who heed His loving call,
find rest indeed.</Contents>

I was sinking deep in sin,
far from the peaceful shore,
very deeply stained within,
sinking to rise no more;
but the Master of the sea
heard my despairing cry,
from the waters lifted me:
now safe am I.
[chorus]
Love lifted me! (Love lifted even me!)
Love lifted me! (Love lifted even me!)
When nothing else could help,
love lifted me!
[2]
All my heart to him I give;
ever to him I'll cling,
in his blessed presence live,
ever his praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true
merits my soul's best songs;
faithful, loving service, too,
to him belongs.

Souls in danger, look above;
Jesus completely saves;
he will lift you by his love
out of the angry waves.
He's the Master of the sea,
billows his will obey;
he your Saviour wants to be -

Over sin, and death, and hell.

    <Contents>[1]
I’ll praise my Maker while I’ve breath,
and when my voice is lost in death,
praise shall employ my nobler powers;
my days of praise shall ne’er be past,
while life, and thought, and being last,
or immortality endures.
[2]
Happy the man whose hopes rely
on Israel’s God! He made the sky,
and earth, and seas, with all their train:
His truth for ever stands secure;
He saves the oppressed, He feeds the poor,
and none shall find His promise vain.
[3]
The Lord gives eyesight to the blind;
the Lord supports the fainting mind;
He sends the labouring conscience peace;
He helps the stranger in distress,
the widow and the fatherless,
and grants the prisoner sweet release.
[4]
I’ll praise Him while He lends me breath,
and when my voice is lost in death,
praise shall employ my nobler powers;
my days of praise shall ne’er be past,
while life, and thought, and being last,
or immortality endures.</Contents>

I’m not ashamed to own my Lord,
or to defend His cause;
maintain the glory of His cross
and honour all His laws.
[2]
Jesus, my Lord! I know His name,
His name is all my boast;
nor will He put my soul to shame,
nor let my hope be lost.
[3]
I know that safe with Him remains,
protected by His power,
what I’ve committed to His hands
till the decisive hour.
[4]
Then will He own His servant’s name
before His Father’s face;
and, in the new Jerusalem,
appoint my soul a place.

(Chorus for Tune 2)
At the cross, at the cross, where I
first saw the light,
and the burden of my heart rolled away,
it was there by faith I received my sight,
and now I am happy all the day.</Contents>

I’ve found a friend in Jesus, He’s everything to me;
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul!
the Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
all I need to cleanse and make me fully whole:
in sorrow He’s my comfort, in trouble He’s my stay;
He tells me every care on Him to roll.
He’s the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star;
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
[2]
He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows borne;
in temptation He’s my strong and mighty tower;
I’ve all for Him forsaken, I’ve all my idols torn
from my heart, and now He keeps me by His power.
Though all the world forsake me and Satan tempt me sore,
through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.
He’s the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star;
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
[3]
He’ll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,
while I live by faith and do His blessed will;
a wall of fire about me, I’ve nothing now to fear;
with His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory, I’ll see His blessed face,
where rivers of delight shall ever roll.
He’s the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star;
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</Contents>

I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
and thus He bound me to Him.
And round my heart still closely twine
those ties which nought can sever,
for I am His, and He is mine,
for ever and for ever!
[2]
I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
He bled, He died to save me;
and not alone the gift of life,
but His own self He gave me,
nought that I have my own I call,
I hold it for the Giver:
my heart, my strength, my life, my all
are His, and His for ever!
[3]
I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
All power to Him is given
to guard me on my onward course,
and bring me safe to heaven.
The eternal glories gleam afar
to nerve my faint endeavour!
So now to watch! to work! to war!
And then to rest for ever!
[4]
I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
So kind, and true, and tender;
so wise a Counsellor and Guide,
so mighty a Defender!
From Him who loves me now so well,
what power my soul can sever?
Shall life or death? or earth or hell?
No! I am His for ever!</Contents>

I’ve something in my heart that Jesus gave to me,
it makes me feel like singing glory all the day:
He found my captive soul and gave me liberty,
and now I feel like singing glory!
[chorus]
He makes the path grow brighter every passing day;
He makes the burden lighter, all along the way;
His Word is my delight, His will I now obey,
and all the time I’m singing glory!
[2]
My Saviour loosed my tongue that I might speak His praise;
since then I have been singing glory all the day;
I love to tell the lost of Jesus and His ways,
and oh, it keeps me singing glory!
[3]
My Saviour took my feet from out the miry clay;
since then I have been singing glory all the day:
He placed them on the Rock that shall not pass away
I cannot keep from singing glory!
[4]
O weary heart and sad, O heavy laden soul,
if you would feel like singing glory all the day,
just let the Saviour in and let Him take control:
then you will feel like singing glory!</Contents>

To Thine open arms of love,

If I gained the world but lost the Saviour,
were my life worth living for a day?
Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
in the things that soon must pass away?
If I gained the world, but lost the Saviour,
would my gain be worth the life-long strife?
Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
for a moment with a Christ-filled life?
[2]
Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,
and a name revered both far and near,
yet no hope beyond, no harbour waiting
where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer -
if I gained the world, but lost the Saviour,
who endured the cross and died for me,
could  then all the world afford a refuge,
whither in my anguish I might flee?
[3]
O what emptiness without the Saviour
mid the sins and sorrows here below!
And eternity, how dark without Him,
only night and tears and endless woe!
What though I might live without the Saviour,
when I come to die, how would it be?
O to face the valley’s gloom without Him!
And without Him all eternity!
[4]
O the joy of having all in Jesus!
What a balm the broken heart to heal!
Ne’er a sin so great but He’ll forgive it,
nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
nothing else in all the world beside,
O then everything is mine in Jesus -
for my needs and more He will provide.</Contents>

If you are encouraged 
in our union with Christ
Finding consolation in His love.
Compassion, warmth and friendship
in the Spirit's flow of life
This is how you make my joy complete

By being of the same mind
And loving with the same love
United in the Spirit
With the same goal in sight
By being of the same mind
And loving with the same love
United in the Spirit
To the glory of Christ

Be sure you do nothing
out of selfishness or pride
Never seeing past your own concerns
But humbly keep your interests
Of each other in your hearts
Seeing them as better than yourselves</Contents>

though foes be strong and walls be high,

Can I not trust the precious blood?
Strong in His word I meet the foe,

ere trials crush, my Father saves,
He hides me till the storm is past,

A higher plane than I have found

Where doubts arise and fears dismay
Tho' some may dwell where these abound
My prayer, my aim is higher ground.

Tho' satan's darts at me are hurled
For faith has caught the joyful sound
The song of saints on higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of glory bright
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found
"Lord, lead me on to higher ground."</Contents>

Most blessèd, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.
[2]
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice like mountains high soaring above
Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.
[3]
To all life Thou givest, to both great and small;
In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
And wither and perish; but naught changeth Thee.
[4]
Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,
Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
All laud we would render: O help us to see
'Tis only the splendour of light hideth Thee.
[5]
Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
Most blessèd, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.</Contents>

In full and glad surrender,
I give myself to Thee,
Thine utterly and only
and evermore to be.
[2]
O Son of God, who lovest me,
I will be Thine alone;
and all I have and am, Lord,
shall henceforth by Thine own!
[3]
Reign over me, Lord Jesus,
O make my heart Thy throne;
it shall be Thine, dear Saviour,
it shall be Thine alone.

O come and reign, Lord Jesus,
rule over everything!
and keep me always loyal
and true to Thee, my King.</Contents>

In heavenly love abiding,
No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding,
For nothing changes here:
The storm may roar without me,
My heart may low be laid;
But God is round about me,
And can I be dismayed?
[2]
Wherever He may guide me,
No want shall turn me back;
My Shepherd is beside me,
And nothing can I lack:
His wisdom ever waketh,
His sight is never dim;
He knows the way He taketh,
And I will walk with Him.
[3]
Green pastures are before me,
Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o'er me,
Where darkest clouds have been;
My hope I cannot measure,
My path to life is free;
My Saviour has my treasure,
And He will walk with me.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
[2]
In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save:
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied -
For every sin on Him was laid;
Here in the death of Christ I live.
[3]
There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain:
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine -
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
[4]
No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand!</Contents>

In loving-kindness Jesus came,
my soul in mercy to reclaim,
and from the depths of sin and shame
through grace He lifted me.
[chorus]
From sinking sand He lifted me;
with tender hand He lifted me;
from shades of night to plains of light,
O praise His name, He lifted me!
[2]
He called me long before I heard,
before my sinful heart was stirred;
but when I took Him at His word,
forgiven He lifted me.
[3]
His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
when from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
in love He lifted me.
[4]
Now on a higher plane I dwell,
and with my soul I know ‘tis well;
yet how or why, I cannot tell,
He should have lifted me.</Contents>

In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
where the water’s cool flow bathes the weary one’s feet,
God leads His dear children along.
[chorus]
Some through the waters, 
some through the flood,
some through the fire, 
but all through the blood;
some through great sorrow,
but God gives a song,
in the night season and all the day long.
[2]
Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.
[3]
Though sorrows befall us and evils oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.</Contents>

In tenderness He sought me,
weary and sick with sin,
and on His shoulders brought me
back to His fold again;
while angels in His presence sang
until the courts of heaven rang.
[chorus]
Oh, the love that sought me!
Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold,
wondrous grace, that brought me to the fold!
[2]
He washed the bleeding sin-wounds,
and poured in oil and wine;
He whispered to assure me,
“I’ve found thee, thou art Mine.”
I never heard a sweeter voice;
it made my aching heart rejoice.
[3]
He pointed to the nail-prints,
for me His blood was shed,
a mocking crown so thorny
was placed upon His head;
I wondered what He saw in me,
to suffer such deep agony.
[4]
I’m sitting in His presence,
the sunshine of His face,
while with adoring wonder
His blessings I retrace.
It seems as if eternal days
are far too short to sound His praise.
[5]
So, while the hours are passing,
all now is perfect rest;
I’m waiting for the morning,
the brightest and the best,
when He will call us to His side,
to be with Him, His spotless bride.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
In the bleak midwinter,
Frosty wind made moan;
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone.
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow;
In the bleak midwinter,
Long ago.
[2]
Our God, heaven cannot hold Him,
Nor earth sustain,
Heaven and earth shall flee away
When He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter
A stable-place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty,
Jesus Christ.
[3]
Angels and archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air.
But His mother only,
In her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the Belovèd
With a kiss.
[4]
What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd,
I would bring a lamb.
If I were a wise man,
I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give Him-
Give my heart.</Contents>

In the image of God, 
We were made long ago,
With the purpose divine,
Here His glory to show;
But we failed Him one day,
And like sheep went astray,
Thinking not of the cost,
We His likeness had lost.

But from eternity God had in mind,
The work of Calvary, the lost to find,
From His heaven so broad,
Christ came down earth to trod,
So that men might live again,
In the image of God.
[2]
Now that I have believed,
And the Saviour received,
Now that I from the cry,
Of my guilt am relieved,
I will live for the Lord,
Not for gain nor reward,
But for love, thinking of what,
His grace has restored!

I'll never comprehend redemption's plan,
How Christ could condescend to die for man,
Such a Saviour I'll praise,
To the end of my days,
As a upward, onward trod,
In the image of God.</Contents>

And I cry holy, holy, holy God,
how awesome is your name.
Holy, holy, holy God,
how majestic is your name,
and I am changed
in the presence of a holy God.

In the presence of your infinite might,
I'm so small and frail and weak;
when I see your pow'r and wisdom, Lord,
I have no words left to speak.

In the presence of your glory
all my crowns lie in the dust.
You are righteous in your judgements, Lord,
you are faithful, true and just.</Contents>

For it has its place in history
Sure He came to set His people free
What is that to me

Till one day I met Him face to face
And I sought the wonder of His grace
Then I knew that He was more than
Just a God who didn't care
That lived away up there, and
Now He walks beside me day by day
Ever watching o'er me lest I stray
Helping me to find that narrow way
He's everything to me</Contents>

Come with thy burden today;

Weary and sighing for rest?

pillow thy head on His breast.

come to His infinite love;
come to the gate that is leading
homeward to mansions above.</Contents>

Is there a mountain in your way?
Do doubts and fears abound
Press on, oh, hear the Spirit say,
'This mountain shall come down.'
[chorus]
Not by might, not by pow'r
By my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts
Not by might, not by pow'r
By my Spirit saith the Lord
This mountain shall be removed
This mountain shall be removed
This mountain shall be removed
By my Spirit saith the Lord
[2]
Is there a river in your path?
A river deep and wide
Step in, the waters will roll back
You'll reach the other side
[3]
Is there a fiery furnace trial
Far more than you can bear?
Behold the blessed Son of God
Is walking with you there.
[4]
Then trust alone the Mighty God
He speaks the winds obey
Take courage then, Oh fainting heart
For you He'll make a way</Contents>

Is your burden heavy 
as you bear it all alone?
Does the road you travel 
harbour danger yet unknown?
Are you growing weary 
in the struggle of it all?
Jesus will help you 
when on His name you call.
[chorus]
He is always there, hearing every prayer, 
faithful and true;
Walking by our side, in His love we hide 
all the day through.
When you get discouraged 
just remember what to do
Reach out to Jesus, 
He's reaching out to you.
[2]
Is the life you're living 
with sorrow and despair?
Does the future press you 
with its worry and its care?
Are you tired and friendless, 
have you almost lost your way?
Jesus will help you, 
just come to Him today.</Contents>

Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is the love of God flowing through you?
Are you telling the lost of the Saviour?
Are you ready His service to do?
[chorus]
Make me a channel of blessing today,
make me a channel of blessing, I pray:
my life possessing, my service blessing,
make me a channel of blessing today.
[2]
Is your life a channel of blessing?
Are you burdened for those that are lost?
Have you urged upon those who are straying,
the Saviour who died on the cross?
[3]
Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is it daily telling for Him?
Have you spoken the word of salvation
To those who are dying in sin?
[4]
We cannot be channels of blessing
if our lives are not free from all sin;
we will barriers be and a hindrance
to those we are trying to win.</Contents>

It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
'Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heaven's all gracious King!'
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.
[2]
Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessèd angels sing.
[3]
Yet with woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long,
Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love-song which they bring:
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing.
[4]
For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendours fling,
And all the world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.</Contents>

It came upon the midnight clear,
that glorious song of old,
from angels bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold:
“Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
from heaven’s all-gracious king!”
The world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing.
[2]
With sorrow brought by sin and strife
the world has suffered long,
and, since the angels sang, have passed
two thousand years of wrong;
for man at war with man hears not
the love-song which they bring:
O hush the noise, you men of strife,
and hear the angels sing!
[3]
And those whose journey now is hard,
whose hope is burning low,
who tread the rocky path of life
with painful steps and slow:
O listen to the news of love
which makes the heavens ring!
O rest beside the weary road
and hear the angels sing!
[4]
And still the days are hastening on -
by prophets seen of old -
towards the fulness of the time
when comes the age foretold:
then earth and heaven renewed shall see
the Prince of Peace, their king;
and all the world repeat the song
which now the angels sing.</Contents>

It is a thing most wonderful,
Almost too wonderful to be,
That God's own Son should come from heaven
And die to save a child like me.
[2]
And yet I know that it is true;
He came to this poor world below,
And wept, and toiled, and mourned, and died,
Only because He loved us so.
[3]
I cannot tell how He could love
A child so weak and full of sin;
His love must be most wonderful,
If He could die my love to win.
[4]
It is most wonderful to know
His love for me so free and sure;
But 'tis more wonderful to see
My love for Him so faint and poor.
[5]
And yet I want to love Thee, Lord;
O light the flame within my heart,
And I will love Thee more and more,
Until I see Thee as Thou art.</Contents>

It is glory just to walk with Him whose

It is joy divine to feel Him near

Bless the Lord, it’s glory all the way!

It is glory just to walk with Him.
It is glory just to walk with Him.
He will guide my steps aright,
through the vale and o’er the height.
It is glory just to walk with Him.

It is glory when the shadows fall, to
know that He is near.
Oh, what joy to simply trust and pray!
It is glory to abide in Him when skies 
above are clear.
Yes, with Him, it’s glory all the way!

‘Twill be glory when I walk with Him 
on heaven’s golden shore,
never from His side again to stray.
‘Twill be glory, wondrous glory with the
Saviour ever-more,
everlasting glory all the way!</Contents>

It may be at morn, when the day is awaking, 
when sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking, 
that Jesus will come in the fullness of glory,
to receive from the world “His own.”
[chorus]
O Lord Jesus, how long?-
How long  ere we shout the glad song?
Christ returneth! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Amen!
[2]
It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,                  
it may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight
will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
when Jesus receives “His own.”
[3]
While hosts cry “Hosanna!” from heaven descending,        
with glorified saints and the angels attending,
with grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,
will Jesus receive “His own.”
[4]
Oh, joy! oh, delight! should we go without dying!
No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying;
caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,
when Jesus receives “His own.”</Contents>

It may not be on the mountain's height,
or over the stormy sea;
it may not be at the battle's front
my Lord will have need of me;
but if by a still, small voice He calls
to paths that I do not know,
I'll answer, “Dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where You want me to go.”
[chorus]
I'll go where You want me to go, dear Lord,
over mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what You want me to say, dear Lord,
I'll be what You want me to be.
[2]
Perhaps today there are loving words
which Jesus would have me speak;
there may be now in the paths of sin
some wanderer whom I should seek;
O Saviour, if Thou wilt be my guide, 
though dark and rugged the way,
my voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what You want me to say.
[3]
There's surely somewhere a lowly place,
in earth's harvest fields so wide,
where I may labour through life's short day
for Jesus the crucified.
So trusting my all to Thy tender care,
and knowing Thou lovest me,
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what You want me to be.</Contents>

O fill me, Saviour, Jesus, with Thy love;
lead, lead me to the living fount above;
thither may I, in simple faith, draw nigh,
and never to another fountain fly,
but unto Thee.

And then, when Jesus face to face I see,
when at His lofty throne I bow the knee,
then of His love, in all its breadth and length,
its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
my soul shall sing.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Jesus calls us; o'er the tumult
of our life's wild restless sea,
day by day His sweet voice soundeth
saying, “Christian, follow Me!”
[2]
As of old, apostles heard it
by the Galilean lake,
turned from home and toil and kindred,
leaving all for His dear sake.
[3]
Jesus calls us from the worship
of the vain world's golden store,
from each idol that would keep us
saying, “Christian, love Me more.”
[4]
In our joys and in our sorrows,
days of toil and hours of ease,
still He calls, in cares and pleasures,
“Christian, love Me more than these.”
[5]
Jesus calls us! By Thy mercies,
Saviour, may we hear Thy call,
give our hearts to Thy obedience,
serve and love Thee best of all.</Contents>

Jesus has loved me, wonderful Saviour!
Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why,
came He to rescue sinners all worthless,
my heart He conquered, for Him I would die.
[chorus]
Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour!
Glory to Jesus, the One I adore.
Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour!
Glory to Jesus, and praise ever-more.

Jesus has saved me, wonderful Saviour!
Jesus has saved me, I cannot tell how;
all that I know is He was my ransom,
dying on Calvary with thorns on His brow.
[3]
Jesus will lead me, wonderful Saviour!
Jesus will lead me, I cannot tell where;
but I will follow, through joy or sorrow,
sunshine or tempest, sweet peace or despair.
[4]
Jesus will crown me, wonderful Saviour!
Jesus will crown me, I cannot tell when;
white throne of splendour hail I with gladness,
crowned ‘mid the plaudits of angels and men.</Contents>

Jesus hath died and hath risen again,
pardon and peace to bestow;
fully I trust Him; from sin’s guilty stain
Jesus saves me now.
[chorus]
Jesus saves me now! 
Jesus saves me now!
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time, 
Jesus saves me now!
[2]
Sin’s condemnation is over and gone,
Jesus alone knoweth how;
life and salvation my soul hath put on;
Jesus saves me now.
[3]
Jesus is stronger than Satan and sin, 
Satan to Jesus must bow,
therefore I triumph without and within;
Jesus saves me now.
[4]
Sorrow and pain may beset me about,
nothing can darken my brow;
battling in faith I can joyfully shout:
Jesus saves me now.</Contents>

Jesus Christ I think upon Your sacrifice
You became nothing
Poured out to death
Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life
And I'm in that place once again
And I'm in that place once again
[chorus]
And once again I look upon
The cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy
And I'm broken inside
Once again I thank you
Once again I pour out my life
[2]
Now you are exalted to the highest place
King of the heavens
Where one day I'll bow
But for now I marvel at this saving grace
And I'm full of praise once again
I'm full of praise once again
[bridge]
Thank you for the Cross,
Thank you for the Cross,
Thank you for the Cross, my friend.
And thank you for the Cross,
Thank you for the Cross,
Thank you for the Cross, my friend.</Contents>

Jesus! I am resting, resting,
in the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
of Thy loving heart.
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
and Thy beauty fills my soul,
for, by Thy transforming power,
Thou hast made me whole.
[chorus]
Jesus! I am resting, resting,
in the joy of what Thou art,
I am finding out the greatness
of Thy loving heart.
[2]
Oh, how great Thy loving kindness,
vaster, broader than the sea!
Oh, how marvellous Thy goodness,
lavished all on me!
Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,
know what wealth of grace is Thine,
know Thy certainty of promise,
and have made it mine.
[3]
Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
I behold Thee as Thou art,
and Thy love so pure, so changeless,
satisfies my heart;
satisfies its deepest longings,
meets, supplies its every need,
compasseth me round with blessings:
Thine is love indeed!
[4]
Ever lift Thy face upon me,
as I work and wait for Thee;
resting ‘neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,
earth’s dark shadows flee.
Brightness of my Father’s glory,
sunshine of my Father’s face,
keep me ever trusting, resting,
fill me with Thy grace.</Contents>

Jesus, I my cross have taken,
all to leave and follow Thee,
destitute, despised, forsaken,
Thou from hence, my all shalt be.
Perish every fond ambition,
all  I've sought, and hoped and known:
yet how rich is my condition!
God and heaven are still my own.
[2]
Let the world despise and leave me:
they have left my Saviour too -
human hearts and looks deceive me:
Thou art not, like them, untrue.
And whilst Thou shalt smile upon me,
God of wisdom, love, and might,
foes may hate, and friends disown me:
show Thy face and all is bright.
[3]
Man may trouble and distress me,
'twill but drive me to Thy breast;
life with trials hard may press me,
heaven will bring me sweeter rest.
Oh! 'tis not in grief to harm me,
while Thy love is left to me;
oh! 'twere not in joy to charm me,
were that joy unmixed with Thee.</Contents>

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
sweetest name on earth;
how can I, a sinner,
come to know its worth?
[2]
Oh! the sinful sorrow,
oh! the strangest shame,
that I saw no beauty
in that sacred name.
[3]
Never felt the sweetness,
never knew the grace,
never saw the love-pain
in that wounded face!
[4]
Never found the mystery
in that simple word,
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Saviour, Lover - Lord.
[5]
Now ‘tis past and over,
gone my sin and shame,
Jesus, Jesus did it,
glory to His name!
[6]
I have seen the glory
of His tender face,
I have felt with wonder,
thrills of holy grace.
[7]
Wonderful compassion
reaching even me,
bows my humbled spirit
in captivity.

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
loved me in my shame,
oh! the joy and rapture
of that sacred name.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Jesus, lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high.
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide;
Oh, receive my soul at last. 
[2]
Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing. 
[3]
Wilt Thou not regard my call?
Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?
Lo! I sink, I faint, I fall-
Lo! on Thee I cast my care.
Reach me out Thy gracious hand!
While I of Thy strength receive,
Hoping against hope I stand,
Dying, and behold, I live. 
[4]
Thou, O Christ, art all I want,
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy Name,
Source of all true righteousness;
Thou art evermore the same,
Thou art full of truth and grace. 
[5]
Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound;
Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart;
Rise to all eternity.</Contents>

For no one else in history is like You,
And history itself belongs to You.

And I will share eternity with You.

It's all about You, Jesus,
And all this is for You,
For Your glory and Your fame.
It's not about me,
As if You should do things my way;
You alone are God,
And I surrender to Your ways.</Contents>

Jesus my King, my wonderful Saviour,
all of my life is given to Thee;
I am rejoicing in Thy salvation,
Thy precious blood now maketh me free.
[chorus]
Wonderful Saviour, wonderful Saviour,
Thou art so near, so precious to me;
wonderful Saviour, wonderful Saviour,
my heart is filled with praises to Thee.
[2]
Freedom from sin, oh, wonderful story!
All of its stains washed whiter than snow,
Jesus has come to live in His temple,
and with His love my heart is aglow.
[3]
Jesus my Lord, I’ll ever adore Thee,
lay at Thy feet my treasures of love;
lead me in ways to show forth Thy glory,
ways that will end in heaven above.
[4]
When in that bright and beautiful city
I shall behold Thy glories untold,
I shall be like Thee, wonderful Saviour,
and I will sing while ages unfold.</Contents>

born in a manger to sorrow and shame,

Seeking for me, for me!

Oh, it was wonderful,  blest be His name,

Jesus, my Saviour, on Calvary’s tree,
paid the great debt, and my soul He set free;
oh, it was wonderful - how could it be?
Dying for me, for me!

Jesus, my Saviour, the same as of old,
while I was wand’ring afar from the fold
gently and long did He plead with my

calling for me, for me!
        Calling for me,….

Jesus, my Saviour, shall come from on high,
sweet is the promise as weary years fly:
oh, I shall see Him descending the sky,
coming for me, for me!

Jesus, Prince and Saviour,
Lord of life who died;
Christ, the friend of sinners,
sinners crucified.
For a lost world’s ransom,
all Himself He gave,
lay at last death’s victim,
lifeless in the grave.
[chorus]
Lord of life triumphant,
risen now to reign!
King of endless ages,
Jesus lives again!
[2]
In His power and Godhead
every victory won;
pain and passion ended,
all His purpose done.
Christ the Lord is risen!
sighs and sorrows past,
death’s dark night is over,
morning comes at last!

Resurrection morning!
Sinners’ bondage freed;
Christ the Lord is risen,
He is risen indeed!
Jesus, Prince and Saviour,
Lord of life who died,
Christ the King of glory
now is glorified!</Contents>

Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
boisterous waves obey Thy will
when Thou say’st to them, “Be still!”
Wondrous Sovereign of the sea,
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me!

When at last I near the shore,

‘twixt me and the peaceful rest,

“Fear not, I will pilot thee!”</Contents>

Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Doth his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
[2]
For Him shall endless prayer be made,
And praises throng to crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.
[3]
People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song,
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.
[4]
Blessings abound where'er He reigns;
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blessed.
[5]
Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honours to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen!</Contents>

Jesus! The name high over all,
In hell, or earth, or sky;
Angels and men before it fall,
And devils fear and fly,
And devils fear and fly.
[2]
Jesus! the name to sinners dear,
The name to sinners given;
It scatters all their guilty fear,
It turns their hell to heaven,
It turns their hell to heaven.
[3]
Jesus! the prisoners' fetters breaks,
And bruises Satan's head;
Power into strengthless souls it speaks,
And life into the dead,
And life into the dead.
[4]
O that the world might taste and see
The riches of His grace!
The arms of love that compass me
Would all mankind embrace,
Would all mankind embrace.
[5]
His only righteousness I show,
His saving grace proclaim;
'Tis all my business here below
To cry: 'Behold the Lamb!'
To cry: 'Behold the Lamb!'
[6]
Happy if with my latest breath
I might but gasp His name;
Preach Him to all, and cry in death:
'Behold, behold the Lamb!'
'Behold, behold the Lamb!'</Contents>

With sweetness fills the breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.

Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blessed name,
O Saviour of mankind!

O hope of every contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who fall how kind Thou art,
How good to those who seek!
[4]
But what to those who find? Ah, this
Nor tongue nor pen can show:
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.
[5]
Jesus, Thy mercies are untold
Through each returning day;
Thy love exceeds a thousandfold
Whatever we can say.

Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our prize wilt be;
Jesus, be Thou our glory now,
And through eternity.</Contents>

Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call;

Refining fire, go through my heart,

scatter Thy life through every part,

where’er our changeful lot is cast,
glad when Thy gracious smile we see,
blest when our faith can hold Thee fast.

Make all our moments calm and bright;
chase the dark night of sin away:
shed o’er the world Thy holy light.</Contents>

I am finding out the greatness
of thy loving heart.
Thou hast bid me gaze upon thee,
and thy beauty fills my soul,
for, by thy transforming power,
thou hast made me whole.

O how great thy loving-kindness,
vaster, broader than the sea!
O how marvellous thy goodness,
lavished all on me!
Yes, I rest in thee, Beloved,
know what wealth of grace is thine,
know thy certainty of promise,
and have made it mine.
[3]
Simply trusting thee, Lord Jesus,
I behold thee as thou art,
and thy love so pure, so changeless,
satisfies my heart;
satisfies its deepest longings,
meets, supplies its every need,
compasseth me round with blessings;
thine is love indeed!
[4]
Ever lift thy face upon me
as I work and wait for thee;
resting 'neath thy smile, Lord Jesus,
earth's dark shadows flee.
Brightness of my Father's glory,
sunshine of my Father's face,
keep me ever trusting, resting,
fill me with thy grace.</Contents>

Join all the glorious names
Of wisdom, love, and power,
That ever mortals knew,
That angels ever bore:
All are too mean to speak His worth,
Too mean to set my Saviour forth.
[2]
Great Prophet of my God,
My tongue would bless Thy name:
By Thee the joyful news
Of our salvation came:
The joyful news of sins forgiven,
Of hell subdued and peace with heaven.
[3]
Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood, and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside:
His powerful blood did once atone,
And now it pleads before the throne.
[4]
My Saviour and my Lord,
My Conqueror and my King,
Thy sceptre and Thy sword,
Thy reigning grace I sing:
Thine is the power; behold, I sit
In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.
[5]
Now let my soul arise,
And tread the tempter down:
My Captain leads me forth
To conquest and a crown.
March on, nor fear to win the day,
Though death and hell obstruct the way.
[6]
Should all the hosts of death,
And powers of hell unknown,
Put their most dreadful forms
Of rage and malice on,
I shall be safe; for Christ displays
Superior power and guardian grace.</Contents>

Joys are flowing like a river
since the Comforter has come:
He abides with us for ever,
makes the trusting heart His home.
[chorus]
Blessed quietness! holy quietness!
What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea, speaking peace 
to me,
how the billows cease to roll!
[2]
Bringing life and health and gladness
all around, this glorious Guest
banished unbelief and sadness,
changed our weariness to rest.
[3]
Like the rain that falls from heaven,
like the sunlight from the sky,
so the Holy Ghost is given,
coming on us from on high.
[4]
See, a fruitful field is growing,
blessed fruits of righteousness!
And the streams of life are flowing
in the lonely wilderness.
[5]
What a wonderful salvation,
where we always see His face!
What a peaceful habitation,
what a quiet resting place!</Contents>

Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come.
[2]
Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come.
[3]
Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come.
[4]
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come.
[5]
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come.
[6]
Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down;
Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come.
[7]
Just as I am, of that free love
The breadth, length, depth and height to prove,
Here for a season, then above,
O Lamb of God, I come.</Contents>

lead me to Calvary.
[chorus]
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
lest I forget Thine agony,
lest I forget Thy love for me,
lead me to Calvary.
[2]
Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
tenderly mourned and wept:
angels in robes of light arrayed,
guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.
[3]
Let me, like Mary, through the gloom,
come with a gift to Thee;
show to me now the empty tomb,
lead me to Calvary.
[4]
May I be willing, Lord, to bear
daily my cross for Thee;
even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.
[5]
Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire
for all who know not Thee;
then touch my lips with holy fire,
to speak of Calvary.</Contents>

Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us;
All our weakness Thou dost know,
Thou didst tread this earth before us,
Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
Tempted, taunted, yet undaunted,
Through the desert Thou didst go.

Fill our hearts with heavenly joy,
Love with every passion blending,
Pleasure that can never cloy;
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy.</Contents>

Let all mortal flesh keep silence
And with fear and trembling stand;
Ponder nothing earthly minded,
For with blessing in His hand
Christ our God to earth descendeth,
Our full homage to demand.
[2]
King of kings, yet born of Mary,
As of old on earth He stood,
Lord of lords, in human vesture,
In the body and the blood:
He will give to all the faithful
His own self for heavenly food.
[3]
Rank on rank the host of heaven
Spreads its vanguard on the way,
As the Light of light descendeth
From the realms of endless day,
That the powers of hell may vanish
As the darkness clears away.
[4]
At His feet the six-winged seraph;
Cherubim with sleepless eye,
Veil their faces to the Presence,
As with ceaseless voice they cry,
Alleluia, alleluia,
Alleluia, Lord most high!</Contents>

Let earth and heaven combine,
angels and men agree,
to praise in songs divine,
the incarnate Deity,
our God contracted to a span,
incomprehensibly made man.
[2]
He laid His glory by,
He wrapped Him in our clay;
unmarked by human eye,
the latent Godhead lay;
infant of days He here became,
and bore the mild Immanuel’s Name.
[3]
Unsearchable the love
that hath the Saviour brought;
the grace is far above
or man or angel’s thought:
suffice for us that God, we know,
our God, is manifest below.
[4]
He deigns in flesh to appear,
widest extremes to join;
to bring our vileness near,
and make us all divine:
and we the life of God shall know,
for God is manifest below.
[5]
Made perfect by His love,
and sanctified by grace,
we shall from earth remove,
and see His glorious face:
then shall His love be fully showed,
and man shall then be lost in God.</Contents>

Let us sing of His love once again,
of the love that can never decay,
of the blood of the Lamb who was slain,
till we praise Him again in that day.
[chorus]
I believe Jesus saves!.
and His blood makes me whiter than snow!
I believe Jesus saves!.
and His blood makes me whiter than
snow!
[2]
There are cleansing and healing for all
who will wash in the life-giving flood;
there is perfect deliverance and joy
to be had in this world through the blood.
I believe Jesus saves….
[3]
Even now, while we taste of His love,
we are filled with delight through His name;
but what will it be when, above,
we shall join in the song of the Lamb?
I believe Jesus saves….
[4]
Then we’ll march in His name till we come,
at His bidding to cease from the fight,
and our Saviour shall welcome us home
To the regions of glory and light.
I believe Jesus saves….
[5]
So with banner unfurled to the breeze,
our motto shall “Holiness” be,
till the crown from His hand we receive,
and the King in His glory we see!
[ending]
I am sure we shall win,
for we fight in the strength of our King.
I am sure we shall win,
for we fight in the strength of our King.</Contents>

May others feel Your love,
Flowing out from them.
Let them know You care for all,
Live through them, Lord,
And let them see.

Let them see what You can do,
With hearts that belong to You,
Let them know the love You
Pour upon Your children.
Let them share the life You give,
That others may truly live,
Let them see,
Let them know You, Lord.</Contents>

Let's Take Time
Let's take time to wait upon the Lord,
Let's take time to listen to His voice,
Unless the Lord builds the house, we labour in vain,
So let's take time to wait upon the Lord.

Life at best is very brief,
like the falling of a leaf,
like the binding of a sheaf,
be in time!
Fleeting days are telling fast
that the die will soon be cast,
and the fatal line be passed,
be in time!
[chorus]
Be in time, be in time,
while the voice of Jesus calls you,
be in time!
If in sin you longer wait,
you may find no open gate,
and your cry be just too late,
be in time!
[2]
Fairest flowers soon decay,
youth and beauty pass away,
oh, you have not long to stay,
be in time!
While the Spirit bids you come,
sinner, do not longer roam,
lest you seal your hopeless doom, be in time!
[3]
Time is gliding swiftly by,
death and judgement drawing nigh,
to the arms of Jesus fly,
be in time!
Oh, I pray you, count the cost,
ere the fatal line be crossed,
and your soul in hell be lost!
Be in time!
[4]
Sinner, heed the warning voice,
make the Lord your final choice,
then all heaven will rejoice,
be in time!
Come from darkness into light,
come, let Jesus make you right,
come, and start for heaven tonight,
be in time!</Contents>

The altars we've built and the works we have done

the hearts of the humble are temples of praise

Glory to the Lord our God;
glory to the Lamb on the throne;
we open wide the gates of our hearts,
with our lips we rise up and praise

Who can ascend to the hill of the Lord?
People of clean hearts and hands.
You, who are righteous and seeking his face,
come and worship the Ancient of Days,
come and worship the Ancient of Days.</Contents>

Over all victorious, in its bright increase:
Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day;
Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.
[chorus]
Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest;
Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.
[2]
Hidden in the hollow of His blessèd hand,
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry touched the Spirit there.
[3]
Every joy or trial falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial by the sun of love.
We may trust Him fully, all for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.</Contents>

for things that could not satisfy;
and then I heard my Saviour speaking:
“Draw from My well that never shall 
run dry.”
[chorus]
Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
Bread of heaven, feed me ‘til I want no more;
fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

There are millions in this world who are craving
the pleasure earthly things afford;
but none can match the wondrous treasure
that I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

So, my brother, if the things this world gave you
leave hungers that won’t pass away,
my blessed Lord will come and save you,
if you kneel to Him and humbly pray:</Contents>

I've been growing in His grace

Well, it's been slow going
But still there's knowing

Be Thou Thyself the answer
to all my questionings.
Live out Thy life within me,
in all things have Thy way!
I, the transparent medium,
Thy glory to display.

The temple has been yielded
and purified of sin;
let Thy Shekinah glory
now flash forth from within.
And all the earth keep silence,
the body henceforth be
Thy silent, docile servant,
moved only as by Thee.

Its members every moment
held subject to Thy call,
ready to have Thee use them,
or not be used at all.
Held without restless longing,
or strain or stress or fret,
or chafings at Thy dealings,
or thoughts of vain regret.
[4]
Kept restful, calm, and pliant,
from bond and bias free,
permitting Thee to settle
when Thou hast need of me.
Live out Thy life within me,
O Jesus, King of kings!
Be Thou the glorious answer
to all my questionings.</Contents>

Living for Jesus a life that is true,
Striving to please Him in all that I do,
Yielding allegiance, gladhearted and free,
This is a pathway of blessing for me.

O Jesus, Lord and Saviour, I give myself to Thee;
For Thou, in Thine atonement, Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master, My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone.
[2]
Living for Jesus who died in my place,
Bearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace,
Such love constrains me to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all.

O Jesus, Lord and Saviour, I give myself to Thee;
For Thou, in Thine atonement, Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master, My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone.
[3]
Living for Jesus wherever I am,
Doing each duty in His Holy Name,
Willing to suffer affliction or loss,
Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

O Jesus, Lord and Saviour, I give myself to Thee;
For Thou, in Thine atonement, Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master, My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone.
[4]
Living for Jesus through earth's little while,
My dearest treasure, the light of His smile,
Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.

O Jesus, Lord and Saviour, I give myself to Thee;
For Thou, in Thine atonement, Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master, My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone.</Contents>

Once for favoured sinners slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph of His train:

Every eye shall now behold Him
Robed in glorious majesty;
Those who set at naught and sold Him,
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing,
Deeply wailing,
Deeply wailing,
Shall their true Messiah see.

Those dear tokens of His passion
Still His dazzling body bears;
Cause of endless exultation
To His ransomed worshippers:
With what rapture,
With what rapture,
With what rapture,
Gaze we on those glorious scars.

Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee,
High on Thine eternal throne;
Saviour, take the power and glory,
Claim the kingdom for Thine own:
Come, Lord Jesus!
Come, Lord Jesus!
Come, Lord Jesus!

Look away to the cross of the Crucified One,
where he purchased salvation for you;
when he laid down his life, and completed the work
that the Father had sent him to do.
[chorus]
Room at the cross, there is room at the cross,
and a welcome that all may receive;
there is room at the cross of the Crucified One,
and redemption for all who believe.
[2]
Look away to the cross of the Crucified One,
to the cross where he suffer'd and bled;
and today he invites you to come if you will,
and be cleansed in the blood that he shed.
[3]
Look away to the cross of the Crucified One,
where the winepress alone he hath trod;
where he cried in his anguish, 'Tis finish'd, 'tis done!'
And commended his Spirit to God.
[4]
There is life at the cross of the Crucified One,
and its hope is abiding and sure;
for the rapture that flows from the love he bestows
shall for ever and ever endure.</Contents>

See the Man of Sorrows now,
From the fight returned victorious;
Every knee to Him shall bow:
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crowns become the Victor's brow.

Crown the Saviour, angels, crown Him;
Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
In the seat of power enthrone Him,
While the vault of heaven rings:
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown the Saviour, King of kings!

Sinners in derision crowned Him,
Mocking thus the Saviour's claim;
Saints and angels throng around Him,
Own His title, praise His name:
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Spread abroad the Victor's fame.
[4]
Hark, those bursts of acclamation!
Hark, those loud triumphant chords!
Jesus takes the highest station:
O what joy the sight affords!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
King of kings, and Lord of lords!</Contents>

Liftest up Thy people's head.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Jesus, true and living Bread.

Here our humblest homage pay we,
Here in loving reverence bow;
Here for faith's discernment pray we,
Lest we fail to know Thee now.

Though the lowliest form doth veil Thee
As of old in Bethlehem,
Here as there Thine angels hail Thee
Branch and Flower of Jesse's stem.

Once for all when Thou wast slain,
In its fulness undiminished
Shall forever more remain,

Cleansing souls from every stain.

Life-imparting, heavenly Manna,
Stricken Rock with streaming side,
Heaven and earth with loud hosanna
Worship Thee, the Lamb who died,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Risen, ascended, glorified!</Contents>

Give me the heart of stone within you,
all I'll give you a heart of flesh.
Clean water I will use to cleanse all you wounds,
My spirit I give to you.

You'll find Me near the broken-hearted,
those crushed in spirit I will save.
So turn to Me for My pardon is great,
My word will heal all your wounds.</Contents>

Lord, I believe a rest remains
to all Thy people known;
a rest where pure enjoyment reigns,
and Thou art loved alone.
[2]
A rest where all our soul’s desire
is fixed on things above;
where fear and sin and grief expire,
cast out by perfect love.
[3]
Oh that I now the rest might know,
believe, and enter in;
now, Saviour, now the power bestow,
and let me cease from sin.
[4]
Remove this hardness from my heart,
this unbelief remove:
to me the rest of faith impart,
the Sabbath of Thy love.
[5]
I would be Thine, Thou knowest I would,
and have Thee all my own;
Thee, O my all-sufficient Good,
I want, and Thee alone.</Contents>

Lord, I hear of showers of blessing
Thou art scattering full and free, 
showers the thirsty land refreshing,
let some drops descend on me,
even me, even me,
let some drops descend on me.

Pass me not, O God, my Father,
sinful though my heart may be!
Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
let Thy mercy light on me, 
even me, even me,
let Thy mercy light on me.

Pass me not, O tender Saviour!
Let me love and cling to Thee.
I am longing for Thy favour;
whilst Thou'rt calling, oh, call me,
even me, even me,
whilst Thou'rt calling, oh call me.
[4]
Pass me not, O mighty Spirit!
Thou canst make the blind to see:
witnesser of Jesus' merit,
speak the word of power to me,
even me, even me,
speak the word of power to me.
[5]
Love of God, so pure and changeless,
blood of Christ, so rich and free;
grace of God, so rich and boundless,
magnify it all in me,
even me, even me,
magnify it all in me.</Contents>

Lord, I make a full surrender,

for Thy love so great and tender
asks the gift of me.

Lord, I bring my whole affection,
claim it, take it for Thine own,
safely kept by Thy protection,
fixed on Thee alone.

Lord, my will I here present Thee,
gladly now no longer mine:
let no evil thing prevent me
blending it with Thine.
[4]
Lord, my life I lay before Thee,
hear, this hour, the sacred vow!
All Thine own I now restore Thee,
Thine for ever now.
[5]
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
I have given my all to God;
and I now have full salvation,
through the precious blood.

Lord, I'm through trying to take

I never knew, but now I think 
I understand.
On my own, wanting it in 
black and white.
On my knees, things are in a 
different light. 
[chorus]
Lead me along the path.
Lead me along the winding way.
I trust enough to never need the why 
if You'll take me to the where.
Lead me along the path.
Lead me along the winding way.
I don't know what's around the corner Lord, 
but I know that You'll be there. 
[2]
Lord I'm through wondering 
what lies in store.
It's up to You, You've never let me 
down before.
Bubbles burst when I'm the one 
who knows what's best.
When You're first, I'm never gonna 
second-guess. 
[bridge]
Helpless alone
Blest be the ties.
My point of view points to You.
You've become my eyes.</Contents>

Whiter than snow, whiter than snow;

Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain,
apply Your own blood and extract every stain;
to get this blest cleansing I all things forego:
now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, look down from Your throne in the skies,
and help me to make a complete sacrifice;
I give up myself and whatever I know:
now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
I wait, blessed Lord, at Your crucified feet;
by faith for my cleansing I see Your blood flow:
now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, You see that  I patiently wait;
come now, and within me a clean heart create:
to those who have sought You , You never said, No:
now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</Contents>

Lord, through the Blood of the Lamb that was slain,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me;
from all the guilt of my sins now I claim
cleansing from Thee, cleansing from Thee.
Sinful and black though the past may have been,
many the crushing defeats I have seen,
yet on Thy promise, O Lord, now I lean,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.

From all the sins over which I have wept,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.
Far, far away, by the Blood-current swept,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.
Jesus, Thy promise I dare to believe,
and as I come Thou dost now me receive,
that over sin I may never more grieve,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.
[3]
From all the doubts that have filled me with gloom,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.
From all the fears that would point me to doom,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.
Jesus, although I may not understand,
in childlike faith now I put forth my hand,
and through Thy word and Thy grace I shall stand,
cleansed by Thee, cleansed by Thee.
[4]
From all the care of what men think or say,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.
From ever fearing to speak, sing, or pray,
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.
Lord, in Thy love and Thy power make me strong,
that all may know that to Thee I belong;
when I am tempted, let this be my song:
cleansing for me, cleansing for me.</Contents>

In the way of answers

And still I seem to stay
In the middle of life's, complications

Leaves me feeling like
I'm chasing down the wind
But now its brought me back to you
And I can see again

This is everything I want
This is everything I need
I want this to be my one
Consuming passion
Everything my heart desires
Lord I want it all to be for you
Jesus
Be my magnificent obsession

So capture my heart again
Take me to depths I've never been
Into the riches of your grace and your mercy
Return me to the cross
Let me be completely lost
In the wonder of the love
That you've shown me

Cut through these chains that tie me down
To so many lesser things
Let all my chains fall to the ground
Until this one remains
[bridge]
You are everything I want
And you are everything I need
Lord, you are all my heart desires
You are everything to me</Contents>

Love divine, all loves excelling,
Joy of heaven to earth come down!
Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
All Thy faithful mercies crown.
Jesus, Thou art all compassion,
Pure unbounded love Thou art;
Visit us with Thy salvation,
Enter every trembling heart.
[2]
Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit
Into every troubled breast!
Let us all in Thee inherit,
Let us find Thy promised rest.
Take away the love of sinning;
Alpha and Omega be;
End of faith, as its beginning,
Set our hearts at liberty.
[3]
Come, Almighty to deliver,
Let us all Thy grace receive;
Suddenly return, and never,
Never more Thy temples leave.
Thee we would be always blessing,
Serve Thee as Thy hosts above,
Pray, and praise Thee without ceasing,
Glory in Thy perfect love.
[4]
Finish then Thy new creation,
Pure and spotless let us be;
Let us see Thy great salvation
Perfectly restored in Thee!
Changed from glory into glory,
Till in heaven we take our place;
Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
Lost in wonder, love and praise.</Contents>

Love Divine, so great and wondrous,
deep and mighty, pure, sublime!
Coming from the heart of Jesus,
just the same through tests of time.
[chorus]
He the pearly gates will open,
so that I may enter in;
for He purchased my redemption
and forgave me all my sin.
[2]
Like a dove when hunted, frightened
as a wounded fawn was I;
broken-hearted, yet He healed me,
He will heed the sinner’s cry.
[3]
Love Divine, so great and wondrous,
all my sins He then forgave!
I will sing His praise forever,
for His blood, His power to save.
[4]
In life’s eventide, at twilight,
at His door I’ll knock and wait;
by the precious love of Jesus
I shall enter heaven’s gate.</Contents>

Love unfailing,
Overtaking my heart,
you take me in,
Finding peace again,
Fear is lost in all you are
[chorus]
And I would give the world to tell your story,
'Cause I know that you've called me,
I know that you've called me,
I've lost myself for good within your promise
And i won't hide it, I won't hide it.
[chorus 2]
Jesus i believe in you, and i would go,
to the ends of the earth,
to the ends of the earth,
for you alone are the son of God, 
And all the world will see,
That you are God, You are God </Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Love was when God became a man,
Locked in time and space, without rank or place;
Love was God born of Jewish kin;
Just a carpenter with some fishermen;

Love was when Jesus walked in history,
Lovingly He brought a new life that's free,
Love was God nailed to bleed and die
To reach and love one such as I. 
[2]
Love was when God became a man,
Down where I could see love that reached to me;
Love was God dying for my sin
And so trapped was I my whole world caved in.

Love was when Jesus met me, now it's real;
Lovingly He came, I can feel He's real!
Love was God, only He would try
To reach and love one such as I. </Contents>

Waiting the coming day,

Up from the grave He arose,
With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
And He lives for ever with His saints to reign:
He arose! He arose!
Alleluia! Christ arose!

Vainly they watch His bed,

Vainly they seal the dead,

Death cannot keep his prey,

    <Contents>[1]
Make me a captive, Lord,
and then I shall be free;
force me to render up my sword,
and I shall conqueror be.
I sink in life's alarms
when by myself I stand;
imprison me within Thine arms, 
and strong shall be my hand.
[2]
My heart is weak and poor
until its master find;
it has no spring of action sure, 
it varies with the wind.
It cannot freely move,
'til Thou hast wrought its chain;
enslave it with Thy matchless love,
and deathless it shall reign.
[3]
My power is faint and low
till I have learned to serve;
it wants the needed fire to glow,
it wants the breeze to nerve;
it cannot drive the world,
until itself be driven; 
its flag can only be unfurled
when Thou shalt breathe from heaven.
[4]
My will is not my own
till Thou hast made it Thine;
if it would reach a monarch's throne
it must its crown resign;
it only stands unbent,
amid the clashing strife,
when on Thy bosom it has leant
and found in Thee its life.</Contents>

Marching on in the light of God,
marching on, I’m marching on;
up the path that the Master trod,
marching, marching on.
[chorus]
A robe of white, a crown of gold,
a harp, a home, a mansion fair,
a victor’s palm, a joy untold,
are mine when I get there.
For Jesus is my Saviour, He’s washed my sins away,
paid my debt on Calvary’s mountain;
happy in His dying love, singing all the day,
I’m living, yes, I’m living in the fountain.
[2]
Marching on through the hosts of sin,
victory’s mine while I’ve Christ within.
[3]
Marching on while the worldlings sneer,
perfect love casteth out all fear.
[4]
Marching on in the Spirit’s might,
more than conqueror in every fight.
[5]
Marching on to the realms above,
there to sing of redeeming love.</Contents>

In the shadow of the rock.

Let me not unheard depart;
Master, speak! for O Thou knowest
All the yearning of my heart,
Knowest all its truest need;
Speak and make me blessed indeed.

When Thy voice is truly heard,
With obedience glad and steady
Still to follow every word.

How wonderful a channel thus to be, to those forlorn,
a messenger of peace and joy and hope, to them that mourn;
O grant that I Thy risen life may share,
the virtue of Thy name to others bear.

Under the anointing daily let me live, a priest and king;
relying not on fleshly energy Thy smile to win;
a simple soul in contact with my Lord, 
in whom all fullness is forever stored.

O teach me, Lord, henceforth with Thee to walk in union deep;
whilst tending other souls not to neglect my own to keep;
a separated soul unto the One
whose grace and love for me so much have done.</Contents>

Shanti dilaye Yesu naam.
(Repeat)
(Peace comes to you in Jesus' name,
Salvation in no other name.)
[1]
Yesu daya ka behta sagar
Yesu daya ka behta sagar
Yesu hai data mahan
Yesu hai data mahan
(Jesus is the Ocean of Grace:
You are majestic, Lord.)
[2]
Charni main tooney janamliya Yesu
Charni main tooney janamliya Yesu
Sooley pay kiya vishram
Sooley pay kiya vishram
(Jesus, You were born in a manger (Made of wood:)
You were crucified on the cross (Made of wood.))
[bridge]
Peace comes to you in Jesus' name,
Salvation in no other name.
[3]
Ham sab key papon ko mitane
Ham sab key papon ko mitane
Yesu hua hai balidan
Yesu hua hai balidan
(For the remission of our sins,
Jesus has been sacrificed on the cross.)
[4]
Krus par apna khoon bahaa kar
Krus par apna khoon bahaa kar
Sara chukaya daam
Sara chukaya daam
(By shedding Your blood on the cross,
You paid the full price for our sins.)</Contents>

Must I go and empty-handed,
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?
[chorus]
Must I go and empty-handed,
Must I meet my Saviour so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him,
Must I empty-handed go?
[2]
Not at death I shrink or falter,
for my Saviour saves me now;
but to meet Him empty-handed,
 thought of that now clouds my brow.
[3]
Oh, the years of sinning wasted!
Could I but recall them now
I would give them to my Saviour;
to His will I gladly bow.
[4]
Oh, ye saints, arouse, be earnest!
Up and work while yet 'tis day;
ere the night of death o'ertake you,
strive for souls while yet you may.</Contents>

My faith has found a resting place,
not in device nor creed;
I trust the ever-living One,
His wounds for me shall plead.
[chorus]
I need no other argument,
I need no other plea,
it is enough that Jesus died,
and that He died for me.
[2]
Enough for me that Jesus saves,
this ends my fear and doubt;
a sinful soul I come to Him,
He’ll never cast me out.
[3]
My heart is leaning on the word,
the written word of God,
salvation by my Saviour’s Name,
salvation through His blood.
[4]
My great Physician heals the sick,
the lost He came to save:
for me His precious blood He shed,
for me His life He gave.</Contents>

Saviour Divine!
Now hear me while I pray;
take all my guilt away;

May Thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart,

as Thou hast died for me,
oh, may my love to Thee
pure, warm, and changeless be,
a living fire!

While life’s dark maze I tread,
and griefs around me spread,
be Thou my Guide;
bid darkness turn to day,
wipe sorrow’s tears away,
nor let me ever stray
from Thee aside.

When ends life’s transient dream,
when death’s cold, sullen stream
shall o’er me roll,
blest Saviour, then, in love,
fear and distrust remove,
oh, bear me safe above,
a ransomed soul!</Contents>

My goal is God Himself, not joy nor peace,
nor even blessing, but Himself, my God:
‘tis His to lead me there, not mine, but His
At any cost, dear Lord, by any road!
[2]
So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,
and love can trust her Lord to lead her there;
upheld by Him my soul is following hard,
till God has full fulfilled my deepest prayer.
[3]
No matter if the way be sometimes dark,
no matter though the cost be oft-times great,
He knows how I best shall reach the mark,
the way that leads to Him must needs be strait.
[4]
One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay;
one thing I do, I press toward my Lord:
my God, my glory here, from day to day,
and in the glory there my Great Reward.</Contents>

How beautiful Thy mercy-seat,
In depths of burning light!

How dread are Thine eternal years,

By prostrate spirits day and night
Incessantly adored!

How wonderful, how beautiful
The sight of Thee must be,
Thine endless wisdom, boundless power,
And awesome purity!

O how I fear Thee, living God,
With deepest, tenderest fears,
And worship Thee with trembling hope
And penitential tears!

Yet I may love Thee too, O Lord,
Almighty as Thou art,
For Thou hast stooped to ask of me
The love of my poor heart.
[6]
No earthly father loves like Thee;
No mother e'er so mild
Bears and forbears as Thou hast done
With me, Thy sinful child.

Father of Jesus, love's reward,
What rapture will it be
Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,
And gaze, and gaze on Thee.</Contents>

with blessings in its flow.

By Zion’s crystal river
His praise shall never end.</Contents>

My heart is fixed, eternal God, 
fixed on Thee, fixed on Thee,
and my unchanging choice is made:
Christ for me!
He is my Prophet, Priest, and King,
who did for me salvation bring;
and while I’ve breath I mean to sing:
Christ for me, Christ for me.
[2]
Let others boast of heaps of gold,
Christ for me, Christ for me.
His riches never can be told,
Christ for me.
Their gold will waste and wear away,
their honours perish in a day,
my portion never can decay;
Christ for me, Christ for me.
[3]
At home, abroad, by night, by day,
Christ for me, Christ for me,
Where’er may lead my pilgrim way,
Christ for me.
Him first and last, Him all day long,
my strength and shield, my fortress strong,
this evermore my hope and song,
Christ for me, Christ for me.
[4]
Now who can sing my song and say -
“Christ for me, Christ for me,
my life and truth, my light and way
Christ for me”?
Then here’s my heart and here’s my hand,
we’ll form a daring, happy band,
and shout aloud throughout the land:
Christ for me, Christ for me!</Contents>

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;

When darkness seems to veil His face
I rest on His unchanging grace;

my anchor holds within the veil.

support me in the ‘whelming flood;
when all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.</Contents>

My Saviour, Thou hast offered rest:
oh! give it, then, to me;
the rest of ceasing from myself,
to find my all in Thee.
This cruel self, oh, how it strives,
and works within my breast,
to come between Thee and my soul,
and keep me back from rest!
[2]
How many subtle forms it takes
of seeming verity,
as if it were not safe to rest
and venture all on Thee.
O Lord, I seek a holy rest,
a victory over sin!
I seek that Thou alone shouldst reign
o’er all, without, within.
[3]
In Thy strong hand I lay me down,
so shall the work be done:
for who can work so wondrously
as Thou, Almighty One!
Work on then, Lord, till on my soul
eternal light shall break,
and, in Thy likeness perfected,
I “satisfied” shall wake.</Contents>

My song is love unknown,
My Saviour's love to me:
Love to the loveless shown,
That they might lovely be.
O who am I, that for my sake
My Lord should take frail flesh and die?
[2]
He came from His blessed throne,
Salvation to bestow;
But men made strange, and none
The longed-for Christ would know:
But O! my Friend, my Friend indeed,
Who at my need His life did spend.
[3]
Sometimes they strew His way,
And His sweet praises sing;
Resounding all the day
Hosannas to their King:
Then 'Crucify!' is all their breath,
And for His death they thirst and cry.
[4]
They rise and needs will have
My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they save,
The Prince of life they slay,
Yet cheerful He to suffering goes,
That He His foes from thence might free.
[5]
In life no house, no home
My Lord on earth might have;
In death, no friendly tomb,
But what a stranger gave.
What may I say? Heaven was His home;
And mine the tomb wherein He lay.
[6]
Here might I stay and sing,
No story so divine;
Never was love, dear King!
Never was grief like Thine.
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise
I all my days could gladly spend.</Contents>

Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to Thee:
E'en though it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song would be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.
[2]
Though, like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone,
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.
[3]
There let the way appear,
Steps up to heaven;
All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.
[4]
Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.
[5]
Or, if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.</Contents>

Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
draw me, my Saviour, so precious Thou art;
fold me, oh fold me close to Thy breast,
shelter me safe in that haven of Rest.
[2]
Nearer, still nearer! Nothing I bring,
naught as an offering to Jesus, my King,
only my sinful, now contrite heart;
grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.
[3]
Nearer, still nearer! Lord to be Thine,
sin with its follies I gladly resign;
all of its pleasures, pomp, and its pride;
give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.
[4]
Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last,
till all its struggles and trials are past;
then through eternity, ever I’ll be
nearer, my Saviour, still nearer to Thee.

Never later than this day
now, my God, Thy power display.
Now, oh cleanse by Jesus' blood,
set me free to live for God.
Vain the worldling's fleeting joys,
vain his pomp, his power, his poise.
Lord, I come again to Thee,
Christ my present Saviour be.
[2]
Now my longing soul, Lord, fill,
now restore to do Thy will,
desperate, Lord, I fall on Thee,
now my God, deliver me.
Perish every vain desire,
burn with pure, celestial fire,
Holy Ghost Thy promise prove,
fill me now with perfect love.
[3]
On Thy Word my stand I take,
Thou dost cleanse for Jesus sake!
Thou the mighty work must do,
to Thy promises be true.
Now the blood doth sanctify,
now with Christ I gladly die,
now the Holy Ghost doth purge,
now, through all, His life doth surge.
[4]
Lord, the wonder of this hour,
God hath come in mighty power,
sinful fetters broken lie,
God by grace hath brought me nigh.
What redemption, Lord, I find!
God possessing heart and mind.
Thou, oh Lord, dost set me free,
all my life I yield to Thee.</Contents>

Nevertheless continually,
O Lord, I am with Thee:
Thou dost me hold by my right hand,
and still upholdest  me.
[2]
Thou, with Thy counsel, while I live,
wilt me conduct and guide;
and to Thy glory afterwards
receive me to abide.
[3]
Whom have I in the heavens high
but Thee, O Lord, alone?
and in the earth whom I desire
besides Thee is none.
[4]
My flesh and heart doth faint and fail,
but God doth fail me never:
for of my heart God is the strength
and portion forever.
[5]
For, lo, they that are far from Thee
for ever perish shall;
Them that a whoring from thee go
thou hast destroyed all.
[6]
But surely it is good for me
that I draw near to God:
In God I trust, that all my works
I may declare abroad.  </Contents>

No eye has seen,

The glorious things
That You have prepared
For everyone who has believed;
You brought us near and You called us Your own,
And made us joint heirs with Your Son.
[chorus]
How high and how wide,
How deep and how long,
How sweet and how strong is Your love;
How lavish Your grace,
How faithful Your ways,
How great is Your love, O Lord.

Objects of mercy,
Who should have known wrath,
We're filled with unspeakable joy;
Riches of wisdom
Unsearchable wealth,
And the wonder of knowing Your voice.
You are our treasure and our great reward,
Our hope and our glorious King.</Contents>

Not a sound invades the stillness,
not a form invades the scene,
save the voice of my Beloved
and the person of my King.
[chorus]
Precious, gentle, holy Jesus!
Blessed Bridegroom of my heart,
in Thy secret inner chamber,
Thou wilt whisper what Thou art.
[2]
And within those heavenly places,
calmly hushed in sweet repose,
there I drink, with joy absorbing
all the love Thou wouldst disclose.
[3]
Wrapped in deep adoring silence,
Jesus, Lord, I dare not move,
lest I lose the smallest saying
meant to catch the ear of love.
[4]
Rest then, O my soul, contented:
Thou hast reached thy happy place,
in the bosom of thy Saviour,
gazing up in His dear face.

Not all the blood of beasts,
on Jewish altars slain,
could give the guilty conscience peace,
or wash away the stain.
[2]
But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
takes all our sins away;
a sacrifice of nobler name
and richer blood than they.
[3]
My faith would lay her hand
on that dear head of Thine,
while like a penitent I stand,
and there confess my sin.
[4]
My soul looks back to see
the burdens Thou didst bear,
when hanging on the cursed tree,
and knows her guilt was there.
[5]
Believing, we rejoice
to see the curse remove;
we bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,
and sing His bleeding love.</Contents>

Not the grandeur of the mountains,

For His love to me is faithful,
and His mercy is divine;
and His truth is everlasting,
and His perfect peace is mine.

Not the streams that fill the valleys,
nor the clouds that drift along,
can delight me more than Jesus
or replace my grateful song:

Yet these all convey His beauty
and proclaim His power and grace -
for they are among the tokens
of the love upon His face:</Contents>

The one eternal God,
Whom earth and heaven adore;
For thus it was, is now,

Thou art our Advocate within.
O plead the truth, and make reply
To every argument of sin.

The way I know, I know my Guide;
Forgive me, O my Friend divine,
That I so often turn aside.

The mystery of my heart can share;
And be Thou known, when fears transcend,
By Thy best name of Comforter.</Contents>

O come, let us sing to the Lord:
come, let us every one
a joyful noise make to the Rock
of our salvation.
[2]
Let us before His presence come
with praise and thankful voice;
let us sing psalms to Him with grace,
and make a joyful noise.
[3]
For God, a great God, and great King,
above all gods He is.
Depths of the earth are in His hand,
the strength of hills is His.
[4]
To Him the spacious sea belongs,
for He the same did make;
the dry land also from His hands
its form at first did take.
[5]
O come, and let us worship Him,
let us bow withal,
and on our knees before the Lord
our Maker let us fall.
[6]
For He’s our God, the people we
of His own pasture are,
and of His hand the sheep; to-day,
if ye His voice will hear.</Contents>

That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.

Rejoice, rejoice! Immanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, O come, Thou Lord of might
Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times didst give the law
In cloud, and majesty, and awe.
[3]
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave.

O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here;
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death's dark shadows put to flight.

O come, Thou Key of David, come
And open wide our heavenly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery.</Contents>

O Father of Jesus, exalted on high,
in sense of our need would we humbly draw nigh,
low down in Thy presence ourselves would abase,
and open our hearts to the inflow of grace.
[chorus]
Here find Thy rest, Saviour most blessed!
By Thy Holy Spirit, come, dwell in each breast!
[2]
Our Father in heaven, by Thy Spirit, we pray,
come, inwardly strengthen Thy servants to-day!
Let Christ, in His love, make our hearts His abode,
that we may be filled with the fullness of God!
[3]
Thy love, in its length and its breadth and its height,
its infinite depth, and its measureless might,
how feebly we know, and how poorly display!
Oh, shed it abroad in us fully to-day!
[4]
Our prayer it is large, and our quest it is deep,
yet surely Thy promise of grace Thou wilt keep.
Exceeding abundantly, past all we pray,
our need Thou canst meet if we trust and obey.</Contents>

O for a closer walk with God,
A calm and heavenly frame,
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb.
[2]
Where is the blessèdness I knew
When I first saw the Lord?
Where is that soul-refreshing view
Of Jesus and His word?
[3]
What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
How sweet their memory still!
But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill.
[4]
Return, O holy Dove! return,
Sweet messenger of rest!
I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
And drove Thee from my breast.
[5]
The dearest idol I have known,
Whate'er that idol be,
Help me tear if from Thy throne,
And worship only Thee.
[6]
So shall my walk be close with God,
Calm and serene my frame;
So purer light shall mark the road
That leads me to the Lamb.</Contents>

O for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free;
A heart that always feels Thy blood
So freely shed for me;

A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
My great Redeemer's throne,
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone;
[3]
A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
Believing, true, and clean;
Which neither life nor death can part
From Him who dwells within;
[4]
A heart in every thought renewed,
And full of love divine;
Perfect and right, and pure, and good:
A copy, Lord, of Thine.
[5]
Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
Come quickly from above;
Write Thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new best name of love.</Contents>

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise,
My great Redeemer's praise!
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!
[2]
Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life, and health, and peace.
[3]
See all your sins on Jesus laid;
The Lamb of God was slain,
The Lamb of God was slain;
His soul was once an offering made
For every soul of man.
[4]
He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.
[5]
He speaks and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
New life the dead receive;
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.
[6]
Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy!
[7]
My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honours of Thy name.</Contents>

Let their faces look up and gaze

O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head!
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner’s stead,
didst bear all ill for me.
A victim led, Thy blood was shed;
now there’s no load for me.
[2]
Death and the curse were in our cup:
O Christ, ‘twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last dark drop,
‘tis empty now for me:
that bitter cup, love drank it up:
now blessing’s draught for me.
[3]
The tempest’s awful voice was heard,
O Christ, it broke on Thee!
Thy open bosom was my ward,
it braved the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, Thy visage
marred,
now cloudless peace for me.
[4]
For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
and I have died in Thee:
Thou’rt risen, my bands are all untied;
and now Thou livest in me:
when purified, made white and tried,
Thy glory then for me!</Contents>

In Thy bright beams which on me fall
fade every evil thought;
that I am nothing, Thou art all,
I would be daily taught.
[4]
More of Thy glory let me see,
Thou Holy, Wise, and True!
I would Thy living image be,
in joy and sorrow too.
[5]
Fill me with gladness from above,
hold me by strength Divine;
Lord, let the glow of Thy great love
through my whole being shine.
[6]
Make this poor self grow less and less,
be Thou my life and aim;
oh, make me daily through Thy grace
more meet to bear Thy name!</Contents>

    <Title1>O Jesus I Have Promised</Title1>

    <Contents>[1]
O Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
Be Thou forever near me,
My Master and my Friend;
I shall not fear the battle
If Thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway
If Thou wilt be my Guide.
[2]
O let me feel Thee near me;
The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear;
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within;
But Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
And shield my soul from sin.
[3]
O let me hear Thee speaking
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will;
O speak to reassure me,
To hasten, or control;
O speak, and make me listen,
Thou Guardian of my soul.
[4]
O Jesus, Thou hast promised
To all who follow Thee
That where Thou art in glory
There shall Thy servants be;
And, Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
O give me grace to follow
My Master and my Friend.
[5]
O let me see Thy footmarks,
And in them plant mine own;
My hope to follow duly
Is in Thy strength alone.
O guide me, call me, draw me,
Uphold me to the end;
And then in heaven receive me,
My Saviour and my Friend.</Contents>

O Lamb of God! Thou wonderful sin-bearer,
hard after Thee my soul doth follow on;
as pants the hart for streams in desert dreary,
so pants my soul for Thee, O Thou life-giving One.
[chorus]
At Thy feet I fall, yield Thee up my all,
to suffer, live, or die for my Lord crucified.
[2]
I mourn, I mourn the sin that drove Thee from me,
and blackest darkness brought into my soul;
now I renounce the accursed thing that hindered,
and come once more to Thee, to be made fully whole.
[3]
Descend the heavens, Thou whom my soul adoreth!
Exchange Thy throne for my poor longing heart;
for Thee, for Thee I watch as for the morning;
no rest or peace is mine from my Saviour apart.
[4]
Come, Holy Ghost, Thy mighty aid bestowing,
destroy the works of sin, the self, the pride;
burn, burn in me, my idols overthrowing,
prepare my heart for Him, for my Lord crucified!</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
O little town of bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.
[2]
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth,
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth;
For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
[3]
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming;
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him, still
The dear Christ enters in.
[4]
O holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in;
Be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Immanuel!</Contents>

My feet to carry the Good News

For You are God, You're the way,

O Love Divine! what hast Thou done?
The immortal God hath died for me!
The Father’s co-eternal Son
bore all my sins upon the tree;
the immortal God for me hath died!
my Lord, my Love is crucified.
[2]
Behold Him, ye that pass Him by,the bleeding Prince of life and peace!
Come, sinners, see your Maker die,
and say, was ever grief like His?
Come, feel with me His blood applied:
my Lord, my Love is crucified:
[3]
Is crucified for me and you,
to bring us rebels back to God:
believe, believe the record true,
ye now are bought with Jesus’ blood,
pardon for sin flows from His side:
my Lord, my Love is crucified.
[4]
Then let us sit beneath His cross,
and gladly catch the healing stream,
all things for Him account but loss,
and give up all our hearts to Him;
of nothing think or speak beside:
my Lord, my Love is crucified.</Contents>

O love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in thee:
I give thee back the life I owe,
That in thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.

O light that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to thee:
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in thy sunshine's blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.
[3]
O joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to thee:
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain,
That morn shall tearless be.
[4]
O cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from thee:
I lay in dust life's glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.</Contents>

step out on the promise,

O ye that are hungry and thirsty, rejoice!
For ye shall be filled; do you hear that sweet voice,

Who sighs for a heart from iniquity free?
O, poor troubled soul! There’s a promise for thee;
there’s rest, weary one, in the bosom of God;

The promise can’t save, though the promise is true;
‘tis the blood we get under that cleanses us through;
it cleanses me now, hallelujah to God!

I rest on the promise,
I rest on the promise,
I rest on the promise,
I’m under the blood.</Contents>

And worship before Him

Praise Him upon earth,
In tuneful accord,
Ye sons of new birth;
Praise Him who hath brought you
His grace from above,
Praise Him who hath taught you
To sing of His love.

O praise ye the Lord,
All things that give sound;
Each jubilant chord,
Re-echo around:
Loud organs, His glory
Forthtell in deep tone,
And sweet harp, the story
Of what He hath done.

O praise ye the Lord!
Thanksgiving and song
To Him be outpoured
All ages along;
For love in creation,
For heaven restored,
For grace of salvation,
O praise ye the Lord!</Contents>

O sacred head, once wounded,
With grief and pain weighed down,
How scornfully surrounded
With thorns, Thine only crown!
How pale art Thou with anguish,
With sore abuse and scorn!
How does that visage languish,
Which once was bright as morn!
[2]
O Lord of life and glory,
What bliss till now was Thine!
I read the wondrous story,
I joy to call Thee mine.
Thy grief and Thy compassion
Were all for sinners' gain;
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But Thine the deadly pain.
[3]
What language shall I borrow
To praise Thee, heavenly Friend,
For this, Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?
Lord, make me Thine for ever,
Nor let me faithless prove;
O let me never, never
Abuse such dying love!
[4]
Be near me, Lord, when dying;
O show Thyself to me;
And for my succour flying,
Come, Lord, to set me free:
These eyes, new faith receiving,
From Jesus shall not move;
For he who dies believing,
Dies safely through Thy love.</Contents>

O sing a new song to the Lord:

Among the heathen nations
His glory do declare;

His works that wondrous are.

For great’s the Lord, and greatly He

yea, worthy to be feared is He
above all gods beside.

For all the gods are idols dumb,
which blinded nations fear;
but our God is the Lord, by whom
the heavens created were.
[5]
Great honour is before His face,
and majesty divine;
strength is within His holy place,
and there doth beauty shine.
[6]
Do ye ascribe unto the Lord,
of people every tribe,
glory do ye unto the Lord,
and mighty power ascribe.
[7]
Give ye the glory to the Lord
that to His name is due;
come ye into His courts, and bring
an offering with you.

In beauty of His holiness,
do the Lord adore;
likewise let all the earth throughout
tremble His face before.</Contents>

O turn, while the Saviour in mercy is waiting,
and steer for the harbour light!
For how do you know but your soul may be drifting
over the dead-line tonight?

O sinner, thine ears have been deaf to His voice,
thine eyes to His glory been dim!
The calls of thy Saviour have so wearied thee,
oh what if they should weary Him?
[3]
O sinner, the Spirit is striving with thee!
What if He should strive never more,
but leave thee alone in thy darkness to dwell,
in sight of the heavenly shore?
[4]
O sinner, God’s patience may weary some day,
and leave thy sad soul in the blast!
By wilful resistance you’ve drifted away
over the dead-line at last.</Contents>

O sinners, come to Jesus!
All other trust is vain;
your every hope must fail you
unless you’re born again.
You need the cleansing fountain
to purge your heart within,
and purify your conscience
from all the stains of sin.
[2]
You need to come to Jesus
and find in Him your rest,
confiding in His goodness,
reclining on His breast.
You need the voice of Jesus
to whisper “Go in peace!”
To calm the inward tempest
and bid the conflict cease.
[3]
You need the power of Jesus
to keep you day by day,
to guard amid temptations
and be your strength and stay.
You need the love of Jesus:
you need this faithful Friend,
to cheer you and to bless you
and guide you to the end.
[4]
Then will you come to Jesus,
in spite of fear and doubt?
He’s waiting now to save you,
and will not cast you out.
if but, in true repentance,
before His cross you bow 
He’ll give you free forgiveness
and full salvation  now,</Contents>

O teach me what it meaneth,

condemned to bleed and die!
O teach me what it cost Thee
to make a sinner whole;
and teach me, Saviour, teach me
the value of a soul!

O teach me what it meaneth,
that sacred crimson tide,
the blood and water flowing
from Thine own wounded side.
Teach me that if none other
had sinned, but I alone,
yet still Thy blood, Lord Jesus,
Thine only, must atone.
[3]
O teach me what it meaneth,
Thy love beyond compare,
the love that reacheth deeper
than depths of self-despair!
Yes, teach me, till there gloweth
in this cold heart of mine,
some feeble, pale reflection
of that pure love of Thine.
[4]
O teach me what it meaneth,
for I am full of sin;
and grace alone can reach me,
and love alone can win.
O teach me, for I need Thee,
I have no hope beside,
the chief of all the sinners
for whom the Saviour died!
[5]
O infinite Redeemer!
I bring no other plea,
because Thou dost invite me
I cast myself on Thee.
Because Thou dost accept me
I love and I adore;
because Thy love constraineth,
I’ll praise Thee evermore!</Contents>

    <Title1>O The Deep Deep Love Of Jesus</Title1>

    <SongNumber>100</SongNumber>
    <Contents>[1]
O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free;
Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fulness over me.
Underneath me, all around me,
Is the current of Thy love;
Leading onward, leading homeward,
To my glorious rest above.
[2]
O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Spread His praise from shore to shore,
How He loveth, ever loveth,
Changeth never, nevermore;
How He watches o'er His loved ones,
Died to call them all His own;
How for them He intercedeth,
Watches over them from the throne.
[3]
O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Love of every love the best:
'Tis an ocean vast of blessing,
'Tis a haven sweet of rest.
O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
'Tis a heaven of heavens to me;
And it lifts me up to glory,
For it lifts me up to Thee.</Contents>

O Thou my soul, bless God the Lord;
and all that in me is
be stirred up, His holy name
to magnify and bless.
[2]
Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God,
and not forgetful be
of all His gracious benefits
He hath bestowed on thee.
[3]
All thine iniquities who doth
most graciously forgive:
who thy diseases all and pains
doth heal, and thee relieve.
[4]
Who doth redeem thy life, that thou
to death may’st not go down;
who thee with loving-kindness doth
and tender mercies crown:
[5]
Who with abundance of good things
doth satisfy thy mouth;
so that, e’en as the eagle’s age,
renewed is thy youth.</Contents>

O Thou who camest from above
The pure celestial fire to impart,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
On the mean altar of my heart.

There let it for Thy glory burn
With inextinguishable blaze,
And trembling to its source return,
In humble prayer and fervent praise.
[3]
Jesus, confirm my heart's desire
To work, and speak, and think for Thee;
Still let me guard the holy fire,
And still stir up Thy gift in me.
[4]
Ready for all Thy perfect will,
My acts of faith and love repeat,
Till death Thy endless mercies seal,
And make the sacrifice complete.</Contents>

O to be like Thee, blessed Redeemer,
this is my constant longing and prayer;
gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures,
Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.
[chorus]
O to be like Thee,
O to be like Thee,
blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
come in Thy sweetness,
come in Thy fulness:
stamp Thine own image deep on my
 heart.
[2]
O to be like Thee, full of compassion,
loving, forgiving, tender and kind,
helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,
seeking the wandering sinner to find.
[3]
O to be like Thee, lowly in spirit,
holy and harmless, patient and brave;
meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
willing to suffer, others to save.
[4]
O to be like Thee, Lord, I am coming,
now to receive the anointing divine,
all that I am and have I am bringing,
Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.
[5]
O to be like Thee, while I am pleading,
pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love,
make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,
fit me for life and heaven above.</Contents>

O what a Saviour that He died for me!
From condemnation He hath made me free;

“hath everlasting life.”
[chorus]
“Verily, verily, I say unto you,
verily, verily,”  message ever new;
“He that believeth on the Son” ‘tis true,
“hath everlasting life.”

All my iniquities on Him were laid,
all my indebtedness by Him was paid;
all who believe on Him, the Lord hath
said,
“hath everlasting life.”
[3]
Though poor and needy I can trust my Lord,
though weak and sinful I believe His word;
O glad message! every child of God,
“hath everlasting life.”
[4]
Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt,
for him that cometh, He will not cast out.
“He that believeth,” O the good news shout,
“hath everlasting life.”</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
O what a wonderful, wonderful day,
day I will never forget;
after I’d wandered in darkness away,
Jesus my Saviour I met.
O what a tender, compassionate friend
He met the need of my heart;
shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,
He made all the darkness depart!
[chorus]
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
when at the cross the Saviour made me whole;
my sins were washed away
and my night was turned to day;
heaven came down and glory filled
my soul!
[2]
Born of the Spirit with life from above
into God’s family divine,
justified fully through Calvary’s love,
O what a standing is mine!
And the transaction so quickly was made
when as a sinner I came,
took of the offer of grace He did proffer;
He saved me, O praise His dear name!
[3]
Now I’ve a hope that will surely endure
after the passing of time;
I have a future in Heaven for sure,
there in those mansions sublime.
And it’s because of that wonderful day,
when at the cross I believed;
riches eternal and blessings supernal
from His precious hand I received.</Contents>

O worship the King,
All glorious above;
O gratefully sing
His power and His love:
Our Shield and Defender,
The Ancient of Days,
Pavilioned in splendour
And girded with praise.
[2]
O tell of His might,
O sing of His grace,
Whose robe is the light,
Whose canopy space;
His chariots of wrath
The deep thunder-clouds form,
And dark is His path
On the wings of the storm.
[3]
The earth, with its store
Of wonders untold,
Almighty, Thy power
Hath founded of old;
Hath 'stablished it fast,
By a changeless decree,
And round it hath cast,
Like a mantle, the sea.
[4]
Thy bountiful care
What tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air,
It shines in the light;
It streams from the hills,
It descends to the plain,
And sweetly distils
In the dew and the rain.
[5]
Frail children of dust,
And feeble as frail,
In Thee do we trust,
Nor find Thee to fail;
Thy mercies how tender,
How firm to the end,
Our Maker, Defender,
Redeemer, and Friend!</Contents>

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;
With gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,
Kneel and adore Him; the Lord is His name.
[2]
Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness,
High on His heart He will bear it for thee,
Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,
Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.
[3]
Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness
Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;
Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,
These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.
[4]
These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,
He will accept for the name that is dear;
Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,
Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.
[5]
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;
With gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,
Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name.</Contents>

Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe.
Doing exactly as the Lord commands, doing it happily.
Action is the key, do it immediately, joy you will receive.
Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe.
O-B-E-D-I-E-N-C-E.
Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe.
[2]
We want to live pure, we want to live `clean, we want to do our best.
Sweetly submitting to authority, leaving to God the rest.
Walking in the light, keeping our attitude right, on the narrow way.
For if we believe the Word we receive, we always will obey.
O-B-E-D-I-E-N-C-E.
Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe.</Contents>

Oh, how sweet the glorious message
simple faith may claim;
yesterday, today, for ever,
Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful,
heal the sick and lame;
cheer the mourner, still the tempest;
glory to His name!
[chorus]
Yesterday, today, for ever,
Jesus is the same.
All may change, but Jesus never!
Glory to His name.
[2]
He who was the Friend of sinners
seeks you, lost one, now;
sinner, come, and at His footstool
penitently bow.
He who said, “I’ll not condemn you,
go, and sin no more,”
speaks to you that word of pardon,
as in days of yore.
[3]
He who pardoned erring Peter,
never need you fear;
He that came to faithless Thomas,
all your doubt will clear.
He who let the loved disciple
on His bosom rest,
bids you still, with love as tender,
lean upon His breast.
[4]
He who, ‘mid the raging billows,
walked upon the sea,
still can hush our wildest tempest,
as on Galilee.
He who wept and prayed in anguish
in Gethsemane,
drinks with us each cup of trembling
in our agony.
[5]
As of old He walked to Emmaus,
with them to abide;
so through all life’s way He walketh
ever near our side.
Soon again shall we behold Him,
hasten, Lord, the day!
But ‘twill still be “this same Jesus,”
as He went away.</Contents>

Oh, praise the Lord! it cleanseth me.

I hear the speaking blood!
It speaks! polluted nature dies!
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

I rise to walk in heaven's own light,

with heart made pure and garments
white,
and Christ enthroned within.

Amazing grace! 'tis heaven below

thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.
[chorus]
Hiding in thee, hiding in thee,
thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.

In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,
in times when temptation casts o'er me its power;
in the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.
[3]
How oft in the conflict when press'd by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe;
how often when trails like sea billows roll,
have I hidden in thee, O thou Rock of my soul.</Contents>

Oh! the bitter shame and sorrow,
that a time could ever be,
when I let the Saviour’s pity
plead in vain, and proudly answered,
“All of self, and none of Thee.”
[2]
Yet He found me: I beheld Him
bleeding on the cursed tree,
heard Him pray, “Forgive them, Father!”
And my wistful heart said faintly:
“Some of self, and some of Thee.”
[3]
Day by day His tender mercy,
healing, helping, full and free,
sweet and strong, and ah! so patient
brought me lower, while I whispered,
“Less of self, and more of Thee.”
[4]
Higher than the highest heavens,
deeper than the deepest sea,
Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered!
Grant me now my soul’s petition:
“None of self, and all of Thee.”

Oh, where are the reapers that gather in
the sheaves of the good from the fields of sin?
With sickles of truth must the work be done,
and no one may rest till the harvest home.
[chorus]
Where are the reapers? Oh, who will come?
And share in the glory of the harvest home?
Oh, who will help us to gather in 
The sheaves of good from the fields of sin?
[2]
Go out in the by-ways and search them all:
the wheat may be there, though the weeds are tall;
then search in the highway, and pass none by,
but gather from all for the home on high.
[3]
The fields are all ripening, and far and wide
the world is awaiting the harvest tide;
but reapers are few, and the work is great,
and much will be lost should the harvest wait.
[4]
So come with your sickles, ye sons of men, 
and gather together the golden grain;
toil on till the Lord of the harvest come,
then share in the joy of the harvest home.</Contents>

who can God's ten commands obey?
Besides me you shall have no god,
nor turn to images to pray.
God's Holy Name, use not in vain,
and keep for Him the Sabbath day.
Honour your parents, you shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal, you shall not lie,
nor covet life your neighbour's way.
We all have failed to keep this law,
but God in love has made a way;
that sinful man could be forgiven,
the Christ who lives for us did die.
Trust Jesus to forgive your sins,
then by His power God's law obey.</Contents>

Oh, worship the King,

Oh, gratefully sing
His power and His love;
our Shield and Defender,
the Ancient of Days,
pavilioned in splendour,
and girded with praise.

Oh, tell of His might,
oh, sing of His grace!
whose robe is the light,
whose canopy space;
His chariots of wrath
the deep thunder-clouds form
and dark is His path
on the wings of the storm.

Thy bountiful care
what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air,
it shines in the light;
it streams from the hills,
it descends to the plain
and sweetly distils
in the dew and the rain.

Frail children of dust,
and feeble as frail, 
in Thee do we trust,
nor find Thee to fail;
Thy mercies how tender,
how firm to the end,
our Maker, Defender,
Redeemer, and Friend.
[5]
Oh, measureless Might,
ineffable Love,
while angels delight
to hymn Thee above,
Thy humbler creation,
though feeble their lays,
with true adoration
shall sing to Thy praise.</Contents>

On a hill far away 
stood an old rugged cross, 
the emblem of suffering and shame; 
and I love that old cross 
where the dearest and best 
for a world of lost sinners was slain. 
[chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross 
till my trophies at last I lay down; 
I will cling to the old rugged cross 
and exchange it some day for a crown.
[2]
O, the old rugged cross, 
so despised by the world, 
has a wondrous attraction for me;
for the dear Lamb of God 
left His glory above 
to bear it to dark Calvary. 
[3]
In the old rugged cross, 
stained with blood so divine,
a wondrous beauty I see;
for 'twas on that old cross 
Jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me.
[4]
To the old rugged cross 
I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear; 
then He'll call me some day 
to my home far away,
when His glory for ever I'll share.</Contents>

On the cross of Calvary,
Jesus died for you and me,
there He shed His precious blood,
that from sin we might be free.
Oh, the cleansing stream doth flow,
and it washes white as snow;
it was for me that Jesus died,
on the cross of Calvary.
[2]
Clouds and darkness veiled the sky
when the Lord was crucified,
“It is finished,” was His cry,
when He bowed His head, and died,
it is finished! - yes, indeed,
all the world may now go free.
It was for this that Jesus died,
on the cross of Calvary.
[3]
Oh, what wondrous, wondrous love,
brought me down at Jesus’ feet!
Oh, such wondrous dying love,
asks a sacrifice complete.
Here I give myself to Thee,
soul and body, Thine to be,
it was for me Thy blood was shed,
on the cross of Calvary.
[4]
Take me, Lord, and seal me Thine,
wholly Thine, for evermore,
sweet assurance, Thou art mine,
and the night of death is o’er.
Cleanse, oh, cleanse my heart from sin,
make and keep me pure within!
It was for this Thy blood was shed
on the cross of Calvary.</Contents>

And as you eat it, remember Me.

And as you drink it, remember Me.

So we thank You for the wine,
And for the bread,
For we see the life You gave, 
And the blood You shed.
And we remember, Your wondrous love,
You gave Your body, You shed Your blood.
And we remember, Your wondrous love
You gave Your body, You shed Your blood.

move with one impulse ev'ry mind;

Both young and old inspire

and give us hearts and tongues of fire,
to pray and praise and love.

Spirit of light, explore

with brightness shining more and more
until the perfect day.
Spirit of truth, we pray,
for ever be our guide;
O Spirit of adoption, may

Once again the Gospel message
from the Saviour you have heard;
Will you heed the invitation?
Will you turn and seek the Lord?
[chorus]
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!
Come believing! come believing!
Come to Jesus! look and live!
[2]
Many summers you have wasted, 
ripened harvests you have seen;
winter snows by spring have melted,
yet you linger in your sin.
[3]
Jesus for your choice is waiting; 
tarry not; at once decide!
While the Spirit now is striving,
yield, and seek the Saviour’s side.
[4]
Cease of fitness to be thinking;
do not longer try to feel!
It is trusting, and not feeling,
that will give the Spirit’s seal.
[5]
Let your will to God be given,
trust in Christ’s atoning blood;
look to Jesus now in heaven,
rest on His unchanging word.</Contents>

bade my doubting, fearing cease

Now I'm trusting every moment,

Once, in royal david's city,
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for His bed.
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ, her little child.
[2]
He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall:
With the poor and meek and lowly
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.
[3]
And through all His wondrous childhood
He would honour and obey,
Love and watch the lowly mother
In whose gentle arms He lay.
Christian children all should be
Mild, obedient, good as He.
[4]
For He is our childhood's pattern:
Day by day like us He grew;
He was little, weak and helpless;
Tears and smiles like us He knew:
And He feeleth for our sadness,
And He shareth in our gladness.
[5]
And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love;
For that child, so dear and gentle,
Is our Lord in heaven above;
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone.
[6]
Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by,
We shall see Him, but in heaven,
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned,
All in white shall wait around.</Contents>

[chorus]
O behold the man of sorrows,
O behold Him in plain view,
lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
since He rent the veil in two,
lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
since He rent the veil in two.
[2]
Yes, He is with God, the Father,
interceding there for you;
for He is the mighty conqueror,
since He rent the veil in two.
[3]
Holy angels bow before Him,
men of earth give praises due;
for He is the well beloved,
since He rent the veil in two.
[4]
Throughout time and endless ages,
heights and depths of love so true;
He alone can be the giver, 
since He rent the veil in two.</Contents>

One day when heaven was filled with His praises,
one day when sin was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
dwelt amongst men, my example is He!
[chorus]
Living, He loved me; dying He saved me;
buried, He carried my sins far away,
rising, He justified freely for ever:
one day He’s coming: O glorious day.
[2]
One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain,
one day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
suffering anguish, despised and rejected;
bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He!
[3]
One day they left Him alone in the garden,
one day He rested, from suffering free;
angels came down o’er His tomb to  keep vigil;
hope of the hopeless, my Saviour is He!
[4]
One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
one day the stone rolled away from the door;
then He arose, over death He had conquered;
now is ascended, my Lord evermore!
[5]
One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
one day the skies with His glory will shine;
wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
glorious Saviour, this Jesus is mine!</Contents>

One fine morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I'll fly away
[chorus]
I'll fly away, O Lord singing, 
I'll fly away
When I rise, Hallelujah, by and by, 
I'll fly away
[2]
When dark shadow of this life draw nigh
I'll fly away
Like a bird far from these prison walls
I'll fly away
[3]
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a home secure and without end
I'll fly away</Contents>

One offer of salvation,
to all the world made known;
the only sure foundation
is Christ, the cornerstone.
[2]
No other name is given,
no other way is known;
'tis Jesus Christ, the first and last:
he saves, and he alone!
[3]
One only door of heaven
stands open wide today;
one sacrifice is given
'tis Christ, the Living Way.
[4]
My only song and story
is Jesus died for me;
my only hope for glory
the Cross of Calvary.</Contents>

One thing I of the Lord desire,
for all my path hath miry been:
be it by water or by fire,
oh, make me clean, oh, make me clean!
[chorus]
So wash me, Thou, without within,
or purge with fire, if that must be;
no matter how, if only sin
die out in me, die out in me.
[2]
I watch to shun the miry way,
and staunch the springs of guilty 
thought;
but, watch and struggle as I may,
pure I am not, pure I am not.
[3]
If clearer vision Thou impart,
grateful and glad my soul shall be,
but yet to have a purer heart
is more to me, is more to me.
[4]
Yea, only as this heart is clean
may larger vision yet be mine,
for mirrored in the depths are seen
the things divine, the things divine.</Contents>

Onward, christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!
Christ, the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See, His banners go!
[chorus]
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
[2]
At the name of Jesus
Satan's host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices;
Loud your anthems raise:
[3]
Like a mighty army
Moves the church of God:
Brothers we are treading
Where the saints have trod.
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.
[4]
Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
'Gainst that church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise,
And that cannot fail:
[5]
Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph-song:
Glory, laud, and honour
Unto Christ the King!
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing:</Contents>

Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed
His tender, last farewell,
a Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed
with us to dwell.
[2]
He came sweet influence to impart,
a gracious, willing guest,
where He can find one humble heart
wherein to rest.
[3]
And His that gentle voice we hear,
soft as the breath of even,
that checks each thought, that calms
each fear,
and speaks of heaven.
[4]
And every virtue we possess,
and every conquest won,
and every thought of holiness,
are His alone.
[5]
Spirit of purity and grace,
our weakness, pitying, see;
oh, make our hearts Thy dwelling place,
and worthier Thee!
[6]
Oh, praise the Father; praise the Son:
blest Spirit, praise to Thee!
All praise to God, the Three in One,
the One in Three.</Contents>

Our Lord is now rejected,
and by the world disowned;
by the many still neglected,
and by the few enthroned;
but soon He’ll come in glory!
The hour is drawing nigh,
for the crowning day is coming
by and by.
[chorus]
Oh, the crowning day is coming!
Is coming by and by!
When our Lord shall come in ‘power’
and ‘glory’ from on high!
Oh, the glorious sight will gladden
each waiting, watchful eye,
in the crowning day that’s coming
by and by.
[2]
The heavens shall glow with splendour;
but brighter far than they,
the saints shall shine in glory,
as Christ shall them array:
the beauty of the Saviour
shall dazzle every eye,
in the crowning day that’s coming
by and by.
[3]
Let all that look for, hasten
the coming joyful day,
by earnest consecration,
to walk the narrow way;
by gathering in the lost ones,
for whom our Lord did die,
for the crowing day that’s comingby and by.</Contents>

Out in the darkness,
shadowed by sin,
souls are in bondage,
souls we would win.
How can we win them?
How show the way?
Love never faileth,
love is the way;
love never faileth,
love is the way.
[2]
Think how the Master
came from above,
suffered on Calvary,
breathing out love;
think how He loves us,
e'en when we stray.
We must love others,
love is the way;
we must love others,
love is His way.
[3]
See, they are waiting,
looking at you,
furtively watching
all that you do:
seeming so careless,
hardened and lost.
Love never faileth,
count not the cost;
love never faileth,
count not the cost.
[4]
Love never faileth,
love is pure gold;
love is what Jesus
came to unfold;
make us more loving,
Master, we pray,
help us remember
love is Thy way;
help us remember
love is Thy way.</Contents>

Let it flow through me,
Let the mighty peace of God
Flow out through me.

Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
[2]
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.
[3]
Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?
In Jesus' presence nought but calm is found.
[4]
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.
[5]
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
[6]
Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours?
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.
[7]
It is enough: earth's struggles soon shall cease,
And Jesus calls us to heaven's perfect peace.</Contents>

Praise God, for He is kind:
His mercy lasts for aye.
Give thanks with heart and mind
to God of gods alway:
[chorus]
For certainly
His mercies dure
most firm and sure
eternally.

The Lord of lords praise ye,
whose mercies still endure.
Great wonders only He
doth work by His great power:
[3]
Give praise to His great name,
who, by His wisdom high,
the heaven above did frame,
and built the lofty sky:
[4]
Who hath remembered us
when in our low estate;
and hath delivered us
from foes who did us hate:
[5]
Who to all flesh gives food;
for His grace faileth never.
Give thanks to God most good,
the God of heaven, for ever:</Contents>

Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessèd redeemer;
Sing, O earth, His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him, hail Him! highest archangels in glory,
Strength and honour give to His holy name.

Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,
In His arms He carries them all day long;
O ye saints that dwell in the mountains of Zion,
Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song.

Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessèd Redeemer;
For our sins He suffered and bled and died.
He, our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,
Hail Him, hail Him! Jesus the Crucified.

Loving Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow,
Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;
Once for us rejected, despised, and forsaken,
Prince of glory, ever triumphant now.
[3]
Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessèd Redeemer;
Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring!
Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever,
Crown Him, crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King!

Death is vanquished, tell it with joy, ye faithful!
Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?
Jesus lives, no longer thy portals are cheerless;
Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.</Contents>

Well our feeble frame He knows;
In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes.

Ye behold Him face to face;
Sun and moon, bow down before Him,
Dwellers all in time and space.

For His love floweth on,

Praise, praise ye the Lamb, who for sinners was slain; 
who went down to the grave and ascended again;
and who soon shall return when these dark days are o’er,  
to set up His kingdom, in glory and power.
[3]
Then the heavens and the earth and the sea shall rejoice; 
the field and the forest shall lift their glad voice;
the sands of the desert shall flourish in green,               
and Lebanon’s glory be shed o’er the scene.

Her bridal attire and her festal array,
all nature shall wear on that glorious day;   
for her King cometh down with His people to reign,

Praise to the holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.
[2]
O loving wisdom of our God!
When all was sin and shame,
A second Adam to the fight
And to the rescue came.
[3]
O wisest love! that flesh and blood,
Which did in Adam fail,
Should strive afresh against the foe,
Should strive and should prevail;
[4]
And that a higher gift than grace
Should flesh and blood refine,
God's presence and His very self,
And essence all-divine.
[5]
O generous love! that He, who smote
In Man for man the foe,
The double agony in Man
For man should undergo;
[6]
And in the garden secretly,
And on the cross on high,
Should teach His brethren, and inspire
To suffer and to die.
[7]
Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And to the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire,
uttered or unexpressed!
The motion of a hidden fire,
that trembles in the breast.
[2]
Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
the falling of a tear,
the upward glancing of an eye,
when none but God is near.
[3]
Prayer is the simplest form of speech
that infant lips can try;
prayer, the sublimest strains that reach
the Majesty on high.
[4]
Prayer is the Christian’s vital breath,
the Christian’s native air,
his watchword at the gates of death;
He enters heaven with prayer.
[5]
The saints in prayer appear as one,
in word, and deed, and mind;
while with the Father and the Son,
sweet fellowship they find.
[6]
O Thou by Whom we come to God,
the Life, the Truth, the Way!
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod,
Lord, teach us how to pray!</Contents>

but when all my struggles ended,
simply trusting, I was blest.
[3]
Consecrated to Thy service,
I will live and die to Thee;
I will witness to Thy glory
of salvation, full and free.
[4]
Yes, I will stand up for Jesus!
He has sweetly saved my soul,
cleansed my heart from sin’s corruption,
sanctified, and made me whole.
[5]
Glory to the Lord who bought me!
Glory for His saving power!
Glory to the Lord who keeps me!
Glory, glory, evermore!</Contents>

Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it,
redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,
redeemed through His infinite mercy;
His child and for ever I am.
[chorus]
Redeemed, Redeemed,
redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
redeemed, redeemed,
His child and for ever, I am.
[2]
Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,
no language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
with me doth continually dwell.
[3]
I know I shall see in His beauty
the King in whose law I delight,
who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
and giveth me songs in the night.
[4]
I know there’s a crown that is waiting
in yonder bright mansion for me,
and soon with the spirits made perfect,
at home with the Lord I shall be.</Contents>

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;

His kingdom cannot fail,
He rules o'er earth and heaven;
The keys of death and hell
Are to our Jesus given:

He sits at God's right hand
Till all His foes submit,
And bow to His command,
And fall beneath His feet:

Rejoice in glorious hope;
Jesus the Judge shall come,
And take His servants up
To their eternal home:

We soon shall hear the archangel's voice;
The trump of God shall sound: rejoice!</Contents>

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave:
weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.
[chorus]
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
[2]
Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
waiting the penitent child to receive.
Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently:
He will forgive if they only believe.
[3]
Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,
feelings lie buried that grace can restore:
touched by a loving hand, wakened by kindness,
chords that were broken will vibrate once more.
[4]
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it!
Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide;
back to the narrow way patiently win them;
tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.</Contents>

Rich are the moments of blessing
Jesus my Saviour bestows;
pure is the well of salvation
fresh from His mercy that flows.
[chorus]
Ever He walketh beside me,
brightly His sunshine appears,
spreading a beautiful rainbow
over the valley of tears.
[2]
Rich are the moments of blessing,
lovely, and hallowed, and sweet,
when from my labour at noon-tide
calmly I rest at His feet.
[3]
Why should I ever grow weary?
Why should I faint by the way?
Has He not promised to give me
strength for the toils of the day?
[4]
Though by the mist and the shadow
sometimes my sky may be dim,
rich are the moments of blessing
spent in communion with Him.</Contents>

Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
[2]
Not the labour of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone:
Thou must save, and Thou alone.
[3]
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly:
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
[4]
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgement throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.</Contents>

that, surging up, defiles my days.
Foul, helpless, all undone,

yet bring me forth to sing Thy praise!

Lord, I Thy word believe
that I in Thee shall live
if I but truly die with Thee.
Make Thou me pure in heart,
grant me the better part
secured by Thine own Blood for me.

Henceforth Thy life is mine
and I am wholly Thine,
my members under Thy control;
kept every day and hour,
held by Thy mighty power,
Thine while eternal ages roll.</Contents>

Give me a faithful heart,

that each departing day
henceforth may see
some work of love begun,
some deed of kindness done,
some wanderer sought and won,
something for Thee.

All that I am and have,
Thy gifts so free,
in joy, in grief, through life,
O Lord, for Thee.
And when Thy face I see,
my ransomed soul shall be,
through all eternity,
something for Thee.</Contents>

Sits amid the cherubim.

Wherefore have ye left your sheep

Lo, we saw a wondrous light:
Angels singing, "Peace on earth"
Told us of the Saviour's birth.'

Thus to come from highest bliss
Down to such a world as this!

Teach us to resemble Thee
In Thy sweet humility.</Contents>

See how great a flame aspires,
kindled by a spark of grace!
Jesus' love the nations fires,
sets the kingdoms on a blaze.
To bring fire on earth He came;
kindled in some hearts it is;
O that all might catch the flame,
all partake the glorious bliss!
[2]
When He first the work begun,
small and feeble was His day;
now the word doth swiftly run,
now it wins its widening way;
more and more it spreads and grows
ever mighty to prevail;
sin's strongholds it now o'erthrows,
shakes the trembling gates of hell.
[3]
Sons of God, your Saviour praise!
He the door hath opened wide;
He hath given the word of grace,
Jesus' word is glorified;
Jesus, mighty to redeem,
He alone the work hath wrought;
worthy is the work of Him,
Him who spake a world from nought.
[4]
Saw ye not the cloud arise,
little as a human hand?
Now it spreads along the skies,
hangs o'er all the thirsty land:
lo!  the promise of a shower
drops already from above;
but the Lord will shortly pour
all the Spirit of His love!</Contents>

that I in revival Thy channel may be.

Coming this way, yes, coming this way,
a mighty revival is coming this way!
Keep on believing, trust and obey;
a mighty revival is coming this way.</Contents>

Send me forth, oh, blessed Master,
where are souls in sorrow bowed;
send me forth to homes of want and 
homes of care;
and with joy I will obey the call,
and in Thy blessed name
I will take the blessed light of the 
gospel there.
[chorus]
Call me forth...to active service,
and my prompt response shall be,
“Here am I! send me.”
I am ready to report for orders,
Master, summon me,
and I'll go on any errand of love for Thee.
[2]
There are lives that may be brightened
by a word of hope and cheer,
there are souls with whom life's
blessings I should share,
there are hearts that may be lightened 
of the burdens which they bear;
let me take the blessed hope of the
gospel there.
[3]
There is work within the vineyard,
there is service to be done,
there's a message of salvation to declare;
send me forth to tell the story to the hearts of sinful men;
let me take the blessed Christ of the
gospel there.
[4]
Oh, I would not be an idler in the vineyard of the Lord;
with the Christ the vineyard labour I would share;
into hearts that know not Jesus I would speak the saving word;
let me take the blessed joy of the gospel there.</Contents>

Send the flood-tides of Thy blessing!
Pour exhaustless draughts of grace;
in the spate of heavenly glory
oh, my God, spare me a place.
Come around us, o'er us, on us,
fill our souls with holy fire,
come in glory, stand among us!
Oh my soul, to God aspire!
[2]
Cleanse! Thou mighty flood-tide - 
cleanse me
purer than the driven snow!
Oh the precious blood doth reach me,
His blessed cleansing now I know!
God is here in matchless splendour,
gone the glory of earth's sun,
blinded by the vision glorious,
Lord in me, Thy will be done.
[3]
Hallelujah! Glory! Glory!
God in majesty doth sweep,
gushing forth a mighty torrent,
o'er land and sea His power doth leap.
Oh Thou Victor - ride in Triumph!
Blood-bought riches Thou must claim,
on till we with hosts of glory
swell forever Thy mighty fame!</Contents>

Send the gospel of salvation, 
to a world of dying men;
tell it out to every nation,
'til the Lord shall come again.
[chorus]
Go and tell them, go and tell them,
Jesus died for sinful men.
Go and tell them, go and tell them,
He is coming, He is coming,
He is coming back again.
[2]
'Tis the church's great commission,
'tis the Master's last command;
Christ has died for every creature,
tell it out in every land.
[3]
Christ is gathering out a people
to His name from every race;
haste to give the invitation
ere shall end the day of grace.
[4]
Give the gospel as a witness
to a world of sinful men;
till the Bride shall be completed,
and the Lord shall come again.</Contents>

Shall we gather at the river,
where bright angel-feet have trod,
with its crystal tide for ever
flowing by the throne of God?
[chorus]
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
the beautiful, the beautiful river;
gather with the saints at the river
that flows by the throne of God.
[2]
On the margin of the river,
washing up its silver spray,
we will walk and worship ever,
all the happy, golden day.
[3]
Ere we reach the shining river,
lay we ev'ry burden down;
grace our spirits will deliver,
and provide a robe and crown.
[4]
At the shining of the river,
mirror of the Saviour's face,
saints, whom death will never sever
raise their songs of saving grace.
[5]
Soon we'll reach the silver river;
soon our pilgrimage will cease;
soon our happy hearts will quiver
with the melody of peace.</Contents>

amid the crowd that gathered around Him,
and straightway she was whole.

Oh, touch the hem of His garment,
and thou, too, shalt be free;
His saving power this very hour
shall give new life to thee.

She came in fear and trembling before Him,
she knew her Lord had come;
she felt that from Him virtue had healed her,
the mighty deed was done.

He turned with, “Daughter, be of good comfort,
thy faith hath made thee whole”;
and peace that passeth all understanding
with gladness filled her soul.</Contents>

Mary and Joseph in stable bare
Watch o'er the Child beloved and fair,
Sleeping in heavenly rest,
Sleeping in heavenly rest.

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds first saw the light,
Heard resounding clear and long,
Far and near, the angel-song:
'Christ the Redeemer is here,
Christ the Redeemer is here.'

Silent night, holy night!
Son of God, O how bright
Love is smiling from Thy face!
Strikes for us now the hour of grace,

praying if the path be drear;

trusting Jesus, that is all.

Trusting Him while life shall last,
trusting Him till earth be past,

Sinners Jesus will receive!
Sound this word of grace to all
who the heavenly pathway leave,
all who linger, all who fall!
[chorus]
Sing it o’er and o’er again,
Christ receiveth sinful men;
make the message clear and plain,
Christ receiveth sinful men.
[2]
Come and He will give you rest;
trust Him for His word is plain;
He will take the sinfulest;
Christ receiveth sinful men.
[3]
Now my heart condemns me not,
pure before the law I stand;
He who cleansed me from all spot
satisfied its last demand.
[4]
Christ receiveth sinful men,
even me with all my sin;
purged from every spot and stain,
Heaven with Him I enter in.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
So send I you to labour unrewarded,
to serve unpaid, unloved,
unsought, unknown,
to bear rebuke, to suffer scorn
and scoffing,
so send I you, to toil for Me alone.
[2]
So send I you to bind the bruised 
and broken,
o'er wandering souls to work, to
weep, to wake,
to bear the burdens of a world
aweary,
so send I you, to suffer for My sake.
[3]
So send I you to loneliness and 
longing,
with heart a-hungering for the loved and known,
forsaking home and kindred,
friend and dear one,
so send I you, to know My love alone.
[4]
So send I you to leave your life's 
ambition,
to die to dear desire, self-will
resign,
to labour long
and love where men revile you,
so send I you,
to lose your life in Mine.
[5]
So send I you to hearts made hard
by hatred,
to eyes made blind because they
will not see,
to spend, though it be blood,
to spend and spare not,
so send I you, to taste of  Calvary.
“As the Father hath sent Me, so send I you.”</Contents>

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
calling for you and for me;
see, on the portals He’s waiting and watching,
watching for you and for me.
[chorus]
Come home, come home;
you who are weary, come home!
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
calling, O sinner, come home!
[2]
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
mercies for you and for me?
[3]
Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
passing from you and from me;
shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming,
coming for you and for me.
[4]
Oh, for the wonderful love He has promised,
promised for you and for me;
though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon,
pardon for you and for me.</Contents>

Soldiers of Christ, arise,
And put your armour on;
Strong in the strength which God supplies,
Through His eternal Son;
Strong in the Lord of hosts,
And in His mighty power;
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror.
[2]
Stand, then, in His great might,
With all His strength endued;
And take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God.
Leave no unguarded place,
No weakness of the soul;
Take every virtue, every grace,
And fortify the whole.
[3]
From strength to strength go on,
Wrestle and fight and pray;
Tread all the powers of darkness down,
And win the well-fought day.
That having all things done,
And all your conflicts past,
Ye may o'ercome, through Christ alone,
And stand complete at last.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Sometimes life seems like words and music,
That can't quite become a song,
So we cry and sigh, then try again,
And wonder what could be wrong?
But when we turn to the Lord,
At the end of ourselves,
Like we've done a time or two before,
We find His truth is the same,
As it's always been,
We never will need more.
[chorus]
It's not in trying, but in trusting,
Not in running, but in resting.
Not in wondering, but in praying,
That we find the strength of the Lord.
[2]
He's all that we need for our ev'ry need,
We never need be alone,
Still, He'll let us go if we choose to,
To live life on our own.
Then the only good that will ever be said,
Of the pains we'll find ourselves in,
They are places to gain,
The wisdom to say, I'll never leave Him again.
[ending]
Not in running, but in resting,
That we find the strength of the Lord.</Contents>

Son of God, you reign in heaven's glory,
yet you chose to come to earth and save me,
humbled yourself to die the cruellest death;
no other act of love compares to this.
[chorus]
The greatest gift I've ever received is the cross, the cross.
For there you gave yourself up for me on the cross, the cross.
And with the blood you poured out for me you have saved my soul.
You have given me the greatest gift of all.
[2]
Your heart aches for all the lost and hurting.
At the cross you wait to take our burdens,
longing to heal our wounds and make us whole;
longing to hear us sing with thankful souls.</Contents>

Sound the gospel of grace abroad,
there’s life in the risen Lord!
Spread the news of the gift of God,
there’s life in the risen Lord!
God above desires it!
Sinful man requires it!
[chorus]
Tell it around, let it abound,
there’s life in the risen Lord.
Tell it around, let it abound,
there’s life in the risen Lord.

All by nature are doomed to die,
so saith the holy word;
welcome therefore the joyful cry,
there’s life in the risen Lord!
Welcome news of gladness -
antidote for sadness.
[3]
Saints, apostles, and prophets all
published with one accord,
this deliverance from the fall,
this life in the risen Lord.
Glory be to Jesus,
who from bondage frees us!
[4]
Pardon, power, and perfect peace
the words of this life afford,
never then let the tidings cease,
of life in the risen Lord.
Open wide the portal
unto every mortal.</Contents>

Sowing in the morning, sowing
seeds of kindness,
sowing in the noon-tide and the 
dewy eves;
waiting for the harvest and the
time of reaping,
we shall come rejoicing, bringing 
in the sheaves.
[chorus]
Bringing in the sheaves, 
bringing in the sheaves,
we shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
Bringing in the sheaves, 
bringing in the sheaves,
we shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
[2]
Sowing in the sunshine, sowing 
in the shadows,
fearing neither clouds nor winter's
chilling breeze; 
by and by the harvest and the 
labour ended,
we shall come rejoicing, bringing 
in the sheaves.
[3]
Go, then, ever weeping, sowing 
for the Master,
though the loss sustained our 
spirit often grieves;
when our weeping's over, He will
bid us welcome,
we shall come rejoicing, bringing 
in the sheaves.</Contents>

Waits my soul upon Thee for the quickening word.

Spirit of faith, come down,
reveal the things of God;
and make to us the Godhead known,
and witness with the blood.
‘Tis thine the blood to apply,
and give us eyes to see
who did for guilty sinners die
hath surely died for me.
[2]
No man can truly say
that Jesus is the Lord,
unless Thou take the veil away,
and breathe the living word;
then, only then, we feel
our interest in His blood,
and cry, with joy unspeakable:
Thou art my Lord, my God!
[3]
O that the world might know
the all-atoning Lamb!
Spirit of faith, descend, and show
the virtue of His Name;
the grace which all may find,
the saving power impart;
and testify to all mankind,
and speak in every heart.
[4]
Inspire the living faith,
which whosoe’er receives,
the witness in himself he hath,
and consciously believes;
the faith that conquers all,
and doth the mountain move,
and saves whoe’er on Jesus call,
and perfects them in love.</Contents>

Standing by a purpose true,
heeding God's command,
honour them the faithful few
all hail to Daniel's band.
Dare to be a Daniel!
Dare to stand alone!
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known.
[2]
Many mighty men are lost,
daring not to stand,
who for God had been a host
by joining Daniel's band.
[3]
Many giants, great and small,
stalking through the land,
headlong to the earth would fall,
if met by Daniel's band.
[4]
Hold the gospel banner high!
On to victory grand!
Satan and his host defy,
and shout for Daniel's band!</Contents>

Standing on the promises of Christ our King,
through eternal ages let His praises ring:
glory in the highest I will shout and sing,
standing on the promises of God.
[chorus]
Standing, standing,
standing on the promises of God,
my Saviour,
standing, standing,
I’m standing on the promises of God.
[2]
Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
when the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
by the living word of God I shall prevail,
standing on the promises of God.
[3]
Standing on the promises I now can seeperfect, 
present cleansing in the blood for me;
standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
standing on the promises of God.
[4]
Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord, 
bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,
overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword,
standing on the promises of God.</Contents>

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
that calls me from a world of care
and bids me at my Father’s throne
make all my wants and wishes known!
In seasons of distress and grief
my soul has often found relief,
and oft escaped the tempter’s snare
by thy return, sweet hour of prayer.
[2]
Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
the joy I feel, the bliss I share,
of those whose anxious spirits burn
with strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
where God, my Saviour, shows His face,
and gladly take my station there,
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.
[3]
Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
thy wings shall my petition bear
to Him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless;
and since He bids me seek His face,
believe His word, and trust His grace,
I’ll cast on Him my every care,
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.</Contents>

Sweet is the promise, “I will not forget thee,”
nothing can molest or turn my soul away;
e’en though the night be dark within the valley,
just beyond is shining an eternal day.
[chorus]
I will not forget thee or leave thee,
in My hands I’ll hold thee, in My arms I’ll fold thee;
I will not forget thee or leave thee
I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
[2]
How can I show my gratitude to Jesus,
for His love unfailing and His tender care?
I will proclaim to others His salvation,
that they may accept Him and His promise share.
[3]
Trusting the promise, “I will not forget thee,”
onward will I go with songs of joy and praise;
though earth despise me, though my friends forsake me,
Jesus will be near me, gladdening my days.
[4]
When at the golden portals I am standing,
all my tribulations, all my sorrows past,
how sweet to hear the blessed proclamation:
Enter faithful servant, welcome home at last.</Contents>

Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
to praise Thy name, give thanks and sing,
to show Thy love by morning light,
and talk of all Thy truth at night.

Sweet is the day of sacred rest,
no mortal cares disturb my breast;
O may my heart in tune be found,
like David’s harp of solemn sound.
[3]
My heart shall triumph in the Lord,
and bless His works, and bless His word;
Thy works of grace, how bright they shine,
how deep Thy counsels, how divine!
[4]
And I shall share a glorious part,
when grace has well refined my heart,
and fresh supplies of joy are shed,
like holy oil, to cheer my head.
[5]
Then shall I see and hear and know
all I desired or wished below;
and every power find sweet employ
in that eternal world of joy.</Contents>

Always, only, for my King;

Every power as Thou shalt choose.

It shall be Thy royal throne.

Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store:
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.</Contents>

Oh, the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,

At the name of Jesus bowing,
falling prostrate at His feet;
King of kings in heaven we’ll crown Him,
when our journey is complete.</Contents>

Make friends of God’s children; help those who are weak;
forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek.

Take time to be holy; the world rushes on;
spend much time in secret with Jesus alone; 
by looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be;
thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.

Take time to be holy! Be calm in thy soul;
each thought and each temper beneath His control,
thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love,
thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.</Contents>

that I may take it in,
that wonderful redemption,
God’s remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often,
for I forget so soon;
“The early dew” of morning
has passed away at noon.

Tell me the story softly,
with earnest tones and grave;
remember I’m the sinner
whom Jesus came to save.
Tell me that story always,
if you would really be
in any time of trouble
a comforter to me.
[4]
Tell me the same old story,
when you have cause to fear
that this world’s empty glory
is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world’s glory
is dawning on my soul,
tell me the old, old story:

how rolled the sea,
tossing the boat in a tempest

Jesus then doing

ended the storm saying
“Peace, peace, be still.”

Show me that scene in the garden,
of bitter pain;
and of the cross where my Saviour
for me was slain;
and, through the sadness,
help me to see
how Jesus suffered
for love of me.
[6]
Gladly I’d hear of His rising
out of the grave,
living and strong and triumphant,
mighty to save:
and how He sends us
all men to bring
stories of Jesus,
Jesus, their King.</Contents>

Tell me the story of Jesus,

Fasting alone in the desert,
tell of the days that He passed;
how He was tried and was tempted,
yet was triumphant at last.
Tell of the years of His labours,
tell of the sorrows He bore;
He was despised and afflicted,
homeless, rejected, and poor.

Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
dying in anguish and pain;
tell of the grave where they laid Him;
tell how He liveth again.
Love, in that story so tender,
clearer than ever I see;
stay, let me weep while you whisper
love paid the ransom for me.</Contents>

Thank You for the price You paid.
Bearing all my sin and shame,
In love You came
And gave amazing grace.
[2]
Thank You for this love, Lord,
Thank You for the nail-pierced hands.
Washed me in Your cleansing flow,
Now all I know:
Your forgiveness and embrace.
[chorus]
Worthy is the Lamb
Seated on the throne,
Crown You now with many crowns.
You reign victorious,
High and lifted up,
Jesus, Son of God,
The darling of heaven crucified.
Worthy is the Lamb.
Worthy is the Lamb.</Contents>

Thank You for the cross the mighty cross
That God Himself should die for such as us
And everyday we're changed into Your image more and more
Yes, by the cross we've truly been transformed.
[chorus]
And we're so amazed, 
and we give You praise
That You would save us at such a cost
We're so amazed, 
and we give You praise
For the power of the cross.</Contents>

Thank you for your mercy,
thank you for your grace;
thank you for your blood
that's made a way
to come into your presence
and glorify your name.
Lord, I stand amazed at what I see.
[chorus]
Great is your mercy toward me,
your loving kindness toward me,
your tender mercies I see
day after day.
For ever faithful to me,
always providing for me,
great is your mercy toward me
great is your grace.
[2]
Your promises are ageless,
your love will never end,
for a thousand generations
your covenant will stand;
showing grace and mercy
to those who fear your name,
establishing your righteousness and praise.</Contents>

Thanks for times now but a memory,
Thanks for Jesus by my side!
Thanks for pleasant, balmy springtime,
Thanks for dark and stormy fall!
Thanks for tears by now forgotten,
Thanks for peace within my soul!

Thanks for prayers that Thou hast answered,
Thanks for what Thou dost deny!
Thanks for storms that I have weathered,
Thanks for all Thou dost supply!
Thanks for pain, and thanks for pleasure,
Thanks for comfort in despair!
Thanks for grace that none can measure,
Thanks for love beyond compare!

Thanks for roses by the wayside,
Thanks for thorns their stems contain!
Thanks for home and thanks for fireside,
Thanks for hope, that sweet refrain!
Thanks for joy and thanks for sorrow,
Thanks for heavenly peace with Thee!

Thanks through all eternity!</Contents>

That man hath perfect blessedness
who walketh not astray
in counsel of ungodly men,
nor stands in sinners’ way,
[2]
nor sitteth in the scorner’s chair:
but placeth his delight
upon God’s law, and meditates
on His law day and night.
[3]
He shall be like a tree that grows
near planted by a river,
which in his season yields his fruit,
and his leaf fadeth never:
[4]
and all he doth shall prosper well.
The wicked are not so;
but like they are unto the chaff,
which wind drives to and fro.
[5]
In judgement therefore shall not stand
such as ungodly are;
nor in the assembly of the just
shall wicked men appear.
[6]
For why? The way of godly men
unto the Lord is known:
whereas the way of wicked men 
shall quite be overthrown.</Contents>

Your blood so pure and holy
Reached a wretched soul like me

The cross upon which Jesus died
is a shelter in which we can hide;
and its grace so free is sufficient for me,
and deep is its fountain as wide as the sea.
[chorus]
There’s room at the cross for you,
there’s room at the cross for you;
though millions have come,
there’s still room for one,
yes, there’s room at the cross for you.
[2]
Though millions have found Him a friend
and have turned from the sins they have sinned,
the Saviour still waits to open the gates
and welcome a sinner before it’s too late.
[3]
The hand of my Saviour is strong,
and the love of my Saviour is long;
through sunshine or rain, through loss or in gain,
the blood flow from Calvary to cleanse every stain.</Contents>

The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended,
The darkness falls at Thy behest;
To Thee our morning hymns ascended,
Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.
[2]
We thank Thee that Thy church unsleeping,
While earth rolls onward into light,
Through all the world her watch is keeping,
And rests not now by day or night.
[3]
As o'er each continent and island
The dawn leads on another day,
The voice of prayer is never silent,
Nor dies the strain of praise away.
[4]
The sun that bids us rest is waking
Our brethren 'neath the western sky,
And hour by hour fresh lips are making
Thy wondrous doings heard on high.
[5]
So be it, Lord! Thy throne shall never,
Like earth's proud empires, pass away;
Thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever,
Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.</Contents>

    <SongNumber>100</SongNumber>
    <Contents>[1]
The first nowell the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
[chorus]
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,
Born is the King of Israel!
[2]
They lookèd up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
[3]
And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
[4]
This star drew nigh to the north-west;
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
[5]
Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
[6]
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
The God of abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days, and God of love.
Jehovah! Great I AM!
By earth and heaven confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred name 
Forever blessed.
[2]
The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise, and seek the joys 
At His right hand.
I all on earth forsake-
Its wisdom, fame, and power-
And Him my only portion make,
Mmy shield and tower.
[3]
The God of Abraham praise,
Whose all-sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days 
In all my ways.
He calls a worm His friend,
He calls Himself my God;
And He shall save me to the end 
Through Jesu's blood.
[4]
He by Himself hath sworn,
I on His oath depend:
I shall, on eagles' wings upborne, 
To heaven ascend;
I shall behold His face,
I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace 
Forever more.
[5]
There dwells the Lord our King,
The Lord our Righteousness,
Triumphant o'er the world and sin, 
The Prince of Peace;
On Zion's sacred height
His kingdom still maintains,
And glorious with His saints in light 
Forever reigns.
[6]
The God who reigns on high
The great archangels sing;
And, holy, holy, holy, cry, 
Almighty King.
Who was and is the same,
And ever more shall be;
Jehovah, Father, Great I AM, 
We worship Thee.
[7]
Before the Saviour's face
The ransomed nations bow;
O'erwhelmed at His almighty grace, 
Forever new:
He shows His prints of love,
They kindle to a flame,
And sound through all the worlds above 
The slaughtered Lamb.
[8]
The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high;
Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! 
They ever cry.
Hail, Abraham's God, and mine!
I join the heavenly lays;  
All might and majesty are Thine, 
And endless praise.</Contents>

The great God of heaven is come down to earth,
his mother a virgin, and sinless his birth;
the Father eternal his Father alone:
he sleeps in the manger; he reigns on the throne:
[chorus]
Then let us adore him, and praise his great love:
to save us poor sinners he came from above.
[2]
A babe on the breast of a maiden he lies,
yet sits with the Father on high in the skies;
before him their faces the seraphim hide,
while Joseph stands waiting, unscared, by his side:
[3]
Lo! here is Emmanuel, here is the Child,
the Son that was promised to Mary so mild;
whose pow'r and dominion shall ever increase,
the Prince that shall rule o'er a kingdom of peace:
[4]
The Wonderful Counsellor, boundless in might,
the Father's own image, the beam of his light;
behold him now wearing the likeness of man,
weak, helpless, and speechless, in measure a span:
[5]
O wonder of wonders, which none can unfold:
the Ancient of Days is an hour or two old;
the maker of all things is made of the earth,
man is worshipped by angels, and God comes to birth:
[6]
Then let us adore him, and praise his great love:
to save us poor sinners he came from above.
[7]
The word in bliss of the Godhead remains,
yet in flesh comes to suffer the keenest of pains;
he is that he was, and for ever shall be,
but becomes that he was not, for you and for me.</Contents>

The chimes of time ring out the news;

Someone slipped and fell.
Was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength, 
your courage to renew.
Do not be disheartened, 
for I have news for you.
[chorus]
It is no secret what God can do.
What He’s done for others,
He’ll do for you.
With arms wide open,
He’ll pardon you;
it is no secret what God can do.
[2]
There is no night, for in His light
you’ll never walk alone.
Always feel at home wherever you may roam.
There is no power can conquer you,
while God is on your side.
Just take Him at His promise;
don’t run away and hide.</Contents>

The church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ, her Lord;
She is His new creation
By water and the word;
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride,
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.
[2]
Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation-
One Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses
With every grace endued.
[3]
Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping,
Their cry goes up, 'How long?'
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.
[4]
'Mid toil, and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forever more;
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blessed,
And the great church victorious
Shall be the church at rest.
[5]
Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won:
O happy ones and holy!
Lord, give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee.</Contents>

My ransomed soul He leadeth,
And where the verdant pastures grow
With food celestial feedeth.
[3]
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
But yet in love He sought me,
And on His shoulder gently laid,
And home rejoicing brought me.
[4]
!n death's dark vale I fear no ill
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
Thy cross before to guide me.
[5]
Thou spread'st a table in my sight;
Thy unction grace bestoweth:
And O what transport of delight
From Thy pure chalice floweth!
[6]
And so through all the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forever.</Contents>

The law of the lord is perfect,
Converting the soul
The Testimony of the Lord is sure
Making wise the simple
[chorus]
More to be desired are they than Gold
Yea than much fine gold
Sweeter also than the honey
And the Honeycomb

The status of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart
The commandment of the Lord is pure
Enlight'ning the eyes

The fear of the Lord is clean
Enduring forever
The judgement of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether</Contents>

The Lord has given a land of good things,

I'll know His power, I'll know His glory,
And in His kingdom I will shine.
[chorus]
With the high praises of God in our mouth
And a two-edged sword in our hand,
We'll march right on to the victory side,
Right into Canaan's land.
[2]
Gird up your armour, ye sons of Zion,
Gird up your armour, let's go to war.
We'll win the battle with great rejoicing,
And so we'll praise Him more and more.
[3]
We'll bind their kings in chains and fetters,
We'll bind their nobles tight in iron,
To execute God's written judgement;
March on to glory, sons of Zion!</Contents>

Him let all angels bless,

Him glorify
sun, moon, and stars;
ye higher spheres,

From God your beings are,
Him therefore famous make;
you all created were,
when He the word but spake.
and from that place,
where fixed you be
by His decree,
you cannot pass.
[3]
Praise God from earth below,
ye dragons, and ye deeps:
fire, hail, clouds, wind, and snow,
whom in command He keeps.
praise ye His name,
hills great and small,
trees low and tall;
beasts wild and tame;
[4]
O let God’s name be praised
above both earth and sky;
for He His saints hath raised
and set their horn on high;
even those that be
of Israel’s race,
near to His grace.
The Lord praise ye.</Contents>

And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E'en for His own name's sake.

Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnishèd
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;
And in God's house forever more
My dwelling place shall be.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
The love of God is greater far
than tongue or pen can ever tell;
it goes beyond the highest star,
and reaches to the lowest hell:
the guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
and pardoned from his sin.
[chorus]
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall for evermore endure,
the saints’ and angels’ song.
[2]
When hoary time shall pass away,
and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
when men who here refuse to pray,
on rocks and hills and mountains call;
God’s love, so sure, shall still endure,
all measureless and strong;
redeeming grace to Adam’s race
the saints and angels song.
[3]
Could we with ink the ocean fill,
and were the skies of parchment made;
were every stalk on earth a quill,
and every man a scribe by trade;
to write the love of God above
would drain the ocean dry;
nor could the scroll contain the whole,
though stretched from sky to sky.</Contents>

All Your scars will still remain.
And forever they will say,

And I want to say…

The Nazarene had come to live 
the life of every man
And he felt the fascination 
of the stars
And as He wandered through this weary world
He wondered and He wept   
For there were so few who'd listen 
to His call
[chorus]
He came, He saw, He surrendered all
So that we might be born again
And the fact of His humanity 
was there for all to see
For He was unlike any other man
And yet so much like me
[2]
The Nazarene could hunger 
and the Nazarene could cry
And He could laugh with all the fullness 
of His heart
And those who hardly knew Him 
And those who knew Him well
Could feel the contradiction 
from the start</Contents>

For the power of Your love is changing me.

The sands of time are sinking,
the dawn of heaven breaks;
the summer morn I’ve sighed for,
the fair sweet morn awakes;
dark, dark hath been the midnight,
but dayspring is at hand,
and glory, glory dwelleth
in Immanuel’s land.
[2]
Oh, Christ, He is the fountain -
the deep sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I’ve tasted,
more deep I’ll drink above;
there to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand,
and glory, glory dwelleth
in Immanuel’s land.
[3]
With mercy and with judgement
my web of time He wove,
and aye the dews of sorrow
were lustred by His love;
I’ll bless the hand that guided,
I’ll bless the heart that planned,
when throned where glory dwelleth
in Immanuel’s land.
[4]
The bride eyes not her garment,
but her dear bridegroom’s face;
I will not gaze at glory
but on my King of grace, 
not at the crown He giveth,
but on His pierced hand;
the Lamb is all the glory
of Immanuel’s land.
[5]
I’ve wrestled on towards heaven,
‘gainst storm and wind and tide;
now like a weary traveller
that leaneth on his guide,
amid the shades of evening,
while sinks life’s lingering sand.
I hail the glory, dawning
in Immanuel’s land.</Contents>

Let troubles rise, and terrors frown,
and days of darkness fall;
through Him all dangers we’ll defy,
and more than conquer all.

Nor death nor life, nor earth nor hell,
nor time’s destroying sway,
can e’er efface us from His heart,
or make His love decay.

Each future period that will bless,
as it has blessed the past;
He loved us from the first of time,
He loves us to the last.</Contents>

The virgin mary had a baby boy,
The Virgin Mary had a baby boy,
The Virgin Mary had a baby boy,
And they said that His name was Jesus.
[chorus]
He come from the glory,
He come from the glorious kingdom.
He come from the glory,
He come from the glorious kingdom.
Oh, yes! believer.
Oh, yes! believer.
He come from the glory,
He come from the glorious kingdom.

The angels sang when the baby was born,
The angels sang when the baby was born,
The angels sang when the baby was born,
And proclaiming Him the Saviour Jesus.
[3]
The wise men saw where the baby was born,
The wise men saw where the baby was born,
The wise men saw where the baby was born,
And they saw that His name was Jesus.</Contents>

There comes to my heart one sweet strain,
a glad and a joyous refrain,
I sing it again and again,
sweet peace, the gift of God's love.
[chorus]
Peace, peace, sweet peace,
wonderful gift from above;
oh, wonderful, wonderful peace,
sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.
[2]
By Christ on the cross peace was made,
my debt by His death was all paid,
no other foundation is laid
for peace, the gift of God's love.
[3]
When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
my heart with this peace did abound,
in Him the rich blessing I found,
sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.
[4]
In Jesus for peace I abide,
and as I keep close to His side,
there’s nothing but peace doth betide
sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.</Contents>

There is a cleansing fountain,
it flows from Calvary,
‘twas opened by the Saviour
from sin each soul to free.
And now His voice is calling
with accents, oh so sweet!
“Come to the cleansing river,
down at the Mercy-seat.”
[chorus]
Oh! Calvary’s stream is flowing,
Calvary’s stream is flowing,
flowing so free for you and for me,
Calvary’s stream is flowing.
[2]
Though worn and heavy laden,
and burdened with your sin,
there’s virtue in the river;
oh, will you enter in?
There’s healing in its waters,
there’s cleansing in its stream;
then look away to Calvary
where mercy’s light does beam.
[3]
This stream of life eternal
for you is flowing free;
oh, bow yourself for cleansing,
and gain your liberty.
Then Christ shall be your Saviour,
and out of you shall flow
a life of peace and heaven,
God’s Paradise below.</Contents>

There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.
[2]
The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day;
And there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins away.
Washed all my sins away, washed all my sins away;
And there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins away.
[3]
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God be saved, to sin no more.
Be saved, to sin no more, be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God be saved, to sin no more.
[4]
E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.
And shall be till I die, and shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.
[5]
Then in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue lies silent in the grave.
Lies silent in the grave, lies silent in the grave;
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue lies silent in the grave.
[6]
Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared, unworthy though I be,
For me a blood bought free reward, a golden harp for me!
'Tis strung and tuned for endless years, and formed by power divine,
To sound in God the Father's ears no other name but Thine.</Contents>

There is a green hill far away,
Outside a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.
[2]
We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.
[3]
He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,
Saved by His precious blood.
[4]
There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven, and let us in.
[5]
O dearly, dearly has He loved!
And we must love Him too,
And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do.</Contents>

There is a love from the Father up above,
Revealed in everything we see,
There is a still voice urging me, go into the world,
His Spirit in my heart leading me.
Go ye therefore into all the world, 
No matter how, be steadfast and bold,
Obey His call to preach His name,
For Jesus now has won the victory.
[chorus]
Go ye in His authority, 
to bring a change in destiny;
Though there's trouble where I tread, 
There will be no turning back;
Go with the vision of the lost,
No matter what the call may cost,
That the Gospel may be preached in 
all the world.</Contents>

The sweetest name on earth.

O, how I love the Saviour's name,
O, how I love the Saviour's name,
O, how I love the Saviour's name,
The sweetest name on earth.

It tells me of a Saviour's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner's perfect plea.

It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in my sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.
[4]
It bids my trembling heart rejoice,
It dries each rising tear;
It tells me in a still, small voice
To trust and never fear.

Jesus, the name I love so well,
The name I love to hear!
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear!</Contents>

There is life for a look at the Crucified One,

then look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved,
unto Him who was nailed to the tree.
[chorus]
Look, look, look and live,
there is life for a look at the 
Crucified One,
there is life at this moment for thee.
[2]
It is not thy tears of repentance nor prayers,
but the blood that atones for the soul;
on Him then believe, and a pardon receive,
for His blood now can make thee quite whole.
[3]
We are healed by His stripes; wouldst thou add to the word?
And He is our righteousness made;
the best robe of heaven He bids thee to wear,
oh, couldst thou be better arrayed?
[4]
Then doubt not thy welcome, since God has declared
there remaineth no more to be done;
that once in the end of the world He appeared,
and completed the work He begun.
[5]
But take, with rejoicing, from Jesus at once,
the life everlasting He gives:
and know with assurance thou never canst die,
since Jesus thy righteousness lives.</Contents>

There were ninety and nine that safely lay
in the shelter of the fold;
but one was out on the hills away,
far off from the gates of gold,
away on the mountains wild and bare,
away from the tender Shepherd’s care;
away from the tender Shepherd’s care.

“Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;
are they not enough for Thee?”
But the Shepherd made answer, “This of Mine
has wandered away from Me;
and, although the road be rough and steep,
I go to the desert to find My sheep,
I go ….
[3]
But none of the ransomed ever knew
how deep were the waters crossed,
nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through,
ere He found His sheep that was lost,
out in the desert He heard its cry,
sick and helpless and ready to die,
sick and….

“Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way,
that mark out the mountain’s track?”
“They were shed for one who had gone astray,
ere the Shepherd could bring him back.”
“Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?”
“They are pierced to-night by many a thorn,
They are….

But all through the mountains, thunder-riven,

And the angels echoed around the throne,
“Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!”

[chorus]
Isn’t the love of Jesus something wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful?
oh, isn’t the love of Jesus something wonderful?
Wonderful it is to me.
[2]
Boundless as the universe around me,
reaching to the farthest soul away;
saving, keeping love it was that found me,
that is why my heart can truly say:
[3]
Love beyond our human comprehending,
love of God in Christ how can it be!
This will be my theme and never ending,
great redeeming love of Calvary.</Contents>

There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave,
a peace it can not take away;
though the trials of life may surround like a cloud,
I’ve a peace that has come there to stay.
[chorus]
Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine;
constantly abiding, rapture divine;
He never leaves me lonely, whispers, O so kind:
“I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.
[2]
All the world seemed to sing of a Saviour and King,
when peace sweetly came to my heart;
troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,
blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!
[3]
This treasure I have in a temple of clay,
while here on His footstool I roam;
but He’s coming to take me some glorious day,
over there to my heavenly home!</Contents>

There’s a Saviour from all sin;
if you only let Him in
to your heart, He there will reign,
while you trust Him.
He will put the evil out,
save from every fear and doubt,
and you’ll soon begin to shout,
“Hallelujah!”
[chorus]
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus is my Saviour King,
He does full salvation bring,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Now with heart and voice I sing
Hallelujah!
[2]
Jesus is a wondrous name,
now and evermore the same.
He can cleanse from every stain,
only trust Him.
He will fill your soul with joy,
and your talents will employ,
Satan’s kingdom to destroy.
Hallelujah!
[3]
If from every sin you part,
and let Christ have all your heart,
you need fear no fiery dart,
while you trust Him.
For while Jesus reigns within,
you are proof against all sin,
and His perfect peace you win,
Hallelujah!</Contents>

There’s a wideness in God’s mercy
like the wideness of the sea;
there’s a kindness in His justice
which is more than liberty.
[2]
There is plentiful redemption
in the blood that has been shed;
there is joy for all the members
in the sorrows of the Head.
[3]
There is grace enough for thousands
of new worlds as great as this;
there is room for fresh creations
in that upper home of bliss.
[4]
For the love of God is broader
than the measures of man’s mind;
and the heart of the Eternal
is most wonderfully kind.
[5]
But we make His love too narrow 
by false limits of our own;
and we magnify His strictness
with a zeal He will not own.
[6]
If our love were but more simple
we should take Him at His word;
and our lives would be illumined
by the presence of our Lord.</Contents>

There’s a depth to His compassion that is
deeper than I’ll understand;
and so my life is safe within His hands.
His love is deep enough for me,
to cause these blinded eyes to see,
to set this lowly captive free from sin.
His grace is flowing from above,
reflected in the Saviour’s love
O precious Father, help me take it in.</Contents>

Jesus knows all about our struggles,
He will guide till the day is done,
there’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus,
no, not one!  no, not one!

No friend like Him is so high and holy,
and yet no friend is so meek and lowly.

There’s not an hour that He is not near us,
no night so dark but His love can cheer us.

Did ever saint find this friend forsake him?
Or sinner find that He would not take him?

Was e’er a gift like the Saviour given?
Will He refuse us a home in heaven?</Contents>

There’s peace in the heart that has Christ for its king;
for His reign and His peace have no end:
in His shelter secure and at rest we can sing,
for His foes to His sceptre must bend.
[chorus]
Then welcome, O Lord, to the throne of my heart!
I’d hail Thee my Saviour and King!
Be Thine all my service, for worthy Thou art,
and forever Thy praise I will sing,
and forever Thy praise I will sing.
[2]
There’s truth in the heart when the Lord reigns within,
in the heart and the life, day by day,
with a conscience that seeks to be blameless from sin
and His bidding alone to obey.
[3]
There’s strength in the heart when the Lord is its king;
not a task, but His grace will empower;
not a foe, but His hand will deprive of its sting; 
blessed Shield and Protector and Tower!
[4]
There’s joy in the heart that has Christ on the throne,
such as none but Himself can impart;
‘tis a joy that remaineth when earth’s joys are flown,
‘tis a fullness of joy in the heart.</Contents>

He is coming in pow'r,

We shall see the King when he comes.

Are you ready should the Saviour call today?
Would Jesus say, 'Well done' or 'Go away'?
He's building a home for the pure,
the vile can never stay.
We shall see the King when he comes.

O my brother, are you ready for the call?
We'll crown our Saviour King and Lord of all.
All the kingdoms of this world
shall soon before him fall.
We shall see the King when he comes.</Contents>

There's a call to the people of Zion,
To arise and possess the land;
Every town has its heirs to the promise,
Every nation its sons of light.
We have stayed long enough on this mountain,
Now we're called to new realms of faith;
We are more than a temple of worship,
We're an army of praise!
[chorus]
We will go to every place,
Sharing mercy and preaching grace,
For the fields are white for harvest,
And labourers are few.
No place too dark, no soul too lost
For the power of the cross;
For His light will shine in darkness,
And many will believe,
So we will go.
[2]
We have drunk of the wine of His presence,
We have feasted upon His word;
Now we're hungry for works of power,
Now we're thirsty to share His love.
He will give us the ground that we walk on,
For the battle belongs to God;
Do not fear, for His grace is sufficient,
When we're weak, He is strong!</Contents>

There's a Friend for little children
above the bright blue sky,
a Friend that never changes,
whose love will never die:
unlike our friends by nature,
who change with changing years,
this Friend is always worthy
the precious name He bears.
[2]
There's a rest for little children
above the bright blue sky,
who love the blessed Saviour,
and to His Father cry:
a rest from every trouble,
from sin and danger free;
there every little pilgrim
shall rest eternally.
[3]
There's a home for little children
above the bright blue sky,
where Jesus reigns in glory,
a home of peace and joy:
no home on earth is like it,
or can with it compare,
for every one is happy,
nor can be happier there.
[4]
There's a crown for little children
above the bright blue sky,
and all who look to Jesus
shall wear it by and by:
a crown of brightest glory,
which He shall sure bestow
on all who love the Saviour,
and walk with Him below.
[5]
There's a song for little children
above the bright blue sky,
and a harp of sweetest music
for their hymn of victory;
and all above is treasured
and found in Christ alone;
O come, dear little children,
that all may be your own!</Contents>

They were gathered in an upper chamber,
as commanded by the risen Lord,
and the promise of the Father
there they sought with one accord,
when the Holy Ghost from heaven 
descended
like a rushing wind and tongues of fire:
so dear Lord, we seek Thy blessing,
come with glory now our hearts inspire.
[chorus]
Let the fire fall, let the fire fall,
let the fire from heaven fall;
we are waiting and expecting,
now in faith, dear Lord, we call;
let the fire fall, let the fire fall,
on Thy promise we depend;
from the glory of Thy presence
let the Pentecostal fire descend.
[2]
As Elijah we would raise the altar
for our testimony clear and true,
Christ the Saviour, loving Healer,
coming Lord, Baptizer too,
ever flowing grace and full salvation,
for a ruined race Thy love has planned;
for this blessed revelation,
for Thy written word we dare to stand.
[3]
'Tis the covenanted promise given
to as many as the Lord shall call,
to the fathers and their children,
to Thy people, one and all;
so rejoicing in Thy word unfailing,
we draw nigh in faith Thy power to
know -
come, O come, Thou burning Spirit,
set our hearts with heavenly fire aglow.
[4]
With a living coal from off Thy altar
touch our lips to swell Thy wondrous
praise,
to extol Thee, bless, adore Thee,
and our songs of worship raise;
let the cloud of glory now descending
fill our hearts with holy ecstasy,
come in all Thy glorious fullness,
blessed Holy Spirit, have Thy way.</Contents>

For her Lord now liveth,
Death hath lost its sting.

Glorious Prince of life;
Life is naught without Thee:
Aid us in our strife;
Make us more than conquerors,
Through Thy deathless love;
Lead us in Thy triumph

Think about His love, 
Think about His goodness,
Think about His grace,
That's bought us through,
For as high as the heaven's above,
So great is the measure of our Father's love,
Great is the measure of our Father's love.
[1]
How could I forget His love?
How could I forget His mercy?
He satisfies, He satisfies,
He satisfies my desires.
Great is the measure of our Father's love.
[2]
Even when I've strayed away,
His love has sought me out and found me,
He satisfies, He satisfies,
He satisfies my desire.
Great is the measure of our Father's love.</Contents>

This is My body, broken for you,
bringing you wholeness, making you free.
Take it and eat it, and when you do,
do it in love for Me.
[2]
This is My blood poured out for you,
bringing forgiveness, making you free.
Take it and drink it, and when you do,
do it in love for Me.
[3]
Back to My father soon I shall go.
Do not forget Me; then you will see
I am still with you, and you will know
you're very close to Me.
[4]
Filled with My Spirit, how you will grow!
You are My branches; I am the tree.
If you are faithful, others will know
you are alive in Me.
[5]
Love one another - I have loved you,
and I have shown you how to be free;
serve one another, and when you do,
do it in love for Me.</Contents>

This is my Father's world:
And to my lis-t'ning ears
All na-ture sings, and round me rings
The mu-sic of the spheres
This is my Father's world
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas-
His hand the won-ders wrought
[2]
This is my Father's world,
The birds their car-ols raise,
The morn-ing light, the lil-y white,
De-clare their Mak-er's praise
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rus-tling grass, I hear Him pass,
He speaks to me ev-'ry-where.
[3]
This is my Father's world,
O let me ne'er for-get
That tho' the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Rul-er yet.
This is my Father's world:
Why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King: let the heav-ens ring!
God reigns: let earth be glad!</Contents>

This is the moment,

You're here in My presence,
You're touching My power,
How I've longed for this moment,
How I've longed for this day,
Come away My beloved,
To our secret place,
Enter into My presence,
Enter into My mercy and grace.

This is My holy place,
This is My secret place,
Receive My love and grace,
As we stand face to face,
Now let My healing flow,
I want the world to know,
This is My secret place,
This is My Holy place.

If you listen you'll hear it,
A call to the nations,
To show forth My praises,
To ev'ry tongue tribe and nation,
If you will not tell them,
How will they know,
That there's joy in My presence,
Like they've never known,
Bring them into My presence,
Let them worship before My throne.

This is Your holy place,
This is Your secret place,
We feel Your love and grace,
As we stand face to face,
Lord let Your healing flow,
So all the world will know,
That there is peace,
There is love, 
There is joy, 
There is praise,

Thou art the everlasting Word,

Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,

In Thee most perfectly expressed
the Father’s glories shine,
of the full deity possessed,
eternally divine!
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
that every knee to Thee should bow.

True image of the infinite,
whose essence is concealed;
brightness of uncreated light,
the heart of God revealed.
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
that every knee to Thee should bow.
[4]
But the high mysteries of Thy name
an angel’s grasp transcend;
the Father only, glorious claim!
the Son can comprehend.
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
that every knee to Thee should bow.
[5]
Yet loving Thee, on whom His love
ineffable doth rest,
Thy glorious worshippers above,
as one with Thee are blest!
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
that every knee to Thee should bow.</Contents>

Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home there was found no room
For Thy holy nativity:
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee.
[2]
Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth cam'st Thou, Lord, on earth,
And in great humility,
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee.
[3]
The foxes found rest, and the birds had their nest,
In the shade of the cedar tree;
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee.
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee.
[4]
Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word
That should set Thy children free;
But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary.
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
Thy cross is my only plea.
[5]
When heaven's arches shall ring, and her choirs shall sing,
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me home, saying, 'Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee.'
And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me.</Contents>

Liberty and gladness I have found 
in Thee,
liberty from bondage, from my 
weary load,
Satan's slave no longer, now a 
child of God!

I am Thine Lord Jesus, ever
Thine, Thine I am,
and my heart is singing, “Glory to the Lamb.”

Living in the sunshine, shining in Thy light,
fighting as Thy soldier, mighty in 
Thy might;
going on Thy mission, pointing men to Thee,
telling of the Saviour who can set them free.
[3]
Such the life, Lord Jesus, I would 
ever live,
such the grateful tribute I would 
ever give;
witnessing for Thee, Lord, everywhere I go,
of the Blood that cleanseth, washing white as snow.
[4]
And when life is ended, when the victory's won,
when I hear from Thee, Lord, the
glad words, “Well done,”
with what joy and rapture shall I
sing of Thee,
who from sin's dark chains didst 
set my spirit free!</Contents>

Through all the changing scenes of life,
In trouble and in joy,
The praises of my God shall still
My heart and tongue employ.

Of His deliverance I will boast,
Till all that are distressed
From my example comfort take,
And charm their griefs to rest.

O magnify the Lord with me,
With me exalt His name;
When in distress to Him I called,
He to my rescue came.

The hosts of God encamp around
The dwellings of the just;
Deliverance He affords to all
Who on His succour trust.
[5]
O make but trial of His love;
Experience will decide
How blest are they, and only they,
Who in His truth confide.
[6]
Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then
Have nothing else to fear;
Make you His service your delight;
Your wants shall be His care.</Contents>

Ours is such a full salvation,

Thy hand, O God has guided
Thy flock, from age to age;
The wondrous tale is written,
Full clear on every page.
Our fathers owned Thy goodness,
And we their deeds record;
And both of this bear witness:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.
[2]
Thy heralds brought glad tidings
To greatest as to least;
They bade them rise and hasten
To share the great King's feast.
And this was all their teaching
In every deed and word;
To all alike proclaiming:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.
[3]
Through many a day of darkness,
Through many a scene of strife,
The faithful few fought bravely
To guard the nation's life.
Their gospel of redemption,
Sin pardoned, man restored,
Was all in this enfolded:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.
[4]
Thy mercy will not fail us,
Nor leave Thy work undone;
With Thy right hand to help us,
The victory shall be won.
And then, by men and angels,
Thy name shall be adored,
And this shall be their anthem:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.</Contents>

Thy Holy Spirit, Lord alone
can turn our hearts from sin;
His power alone can sanctify
and keep us pure within.
[chorus]
O Spirit of Faith and Love,
come in our midst, we pray,
and purify each waiting heart;
baptise us with power today.
[2]
Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone
can deeper love inspire;
His power alone within our souls
can light the sacred fire.
[3]
Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can bring
the gifts we seek in prayer;
His voice can words of comfort speak
and still each wave of care.
[4]
Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can give
the grace we need this hour;
and while we wait, O Spirit, come
in sanctifying power.
[ending]
O Spirit of love, descend
come in our midst, we pray
and like a rushing, mighty wind
sweep over our souls today.</Contents>

Thy life was given for me,
Thy blood, O Lord, was shed,
that I might ransomed be,
and quickened from the dead:
Thy life, Thy life was given for me;
what have I given for Thee?
[2]
Thy Father's home of light,
Thy rainbow-circled throne,
were left for earthly night,
for wanderings sad and lone;
yea, all, yea, all was left for me;
have I left aught for Thee?
[3]
Thou, Lord, hast borne for me
more than my tongue can tell
of bitterest agony,
to rescue me from hell;
Thou sufferedst all for me, for me;
what have I borne for Thee?
[4]
Oh, let my life be given,
my years for Thee be spent;
world-fetters all be riven,
and joy with suffering blent.
To Thee, to Thee my all I bring,
my Saviour and my King!

Thy word is to my feet a lamp,
and to my path a light.
I sworn have, and I will perform,
to keep Thy judgements right.
[2]
I am with sore affliction
even overwhelmed, O Lord:
In mercy raise and quicken me,
according to Thy word.
[3]
The free-will-offerings of my mouth
accept, I Thee beseech:
and unto me Thy servant, Lord,
Thy judgements clearly teach.
[4]
Though still my soul be in my hand,
Thy laws I’ll not forget.
I erred not from them, though for me
the wicked snares did set.
[5]
I of Thy testimonies have
above all things made choice,
to be my heritage for aye;
for they my heart rejoice.
[6]
I carefully inclined have
my heart still to attend;
that I Thy statutes may perform
alway unto the end.</Contents>

‘Tis finished! the Messiah dies,
cut off for sin, but not His own;
accomplished is the sacrifice,
the great redeeming work is done.
‘Tis finished! all the debt is paid,
justice divine is satisfied,
the grand and full atonement made;
God for a guilty world hath died.
[2]
The veil is rent in Christ alone;
the living way to heaven is seen;
the middle wall is broken down,
and all mankind may enter in.
The types and figures are fulfilled,
exacted is the legal pain,
the precious promises are sealed;
the spotless Lamb of God is slain.
[3]
The reign of sin and death is o’er,
and all may live from sin set free;
Satan has lost his mortal power;
‘tis swallowed up in victory.
Saved from the legal curse I am,
my Saviour hangs on yonder tree:
see there the meek, expiring Lamb!
‘Tis finished, He expires for me.
[4]
Accepted in the well-beloved,
and clothed in righteousness divine,
I see the bar to heaven removed,
and all Thy merits, Lord, are mine.
Death, hell, and sin are now subdued,
all grace is now to sinners given,
and lo, I plead the atoning blood,
and in Thy right I claim Thy heaven.</Contents>

thrones and powers before Him bending,
odours sweet with voice ascending,
swell the chorus never ending,

Every kindred, tongue, and nation,
worthy the Lamb;
join to sing the great salvation,
worthy the Lamb.
loud as mighty thunders roaring,
floods of mighty waters pouring,
prostrate at His feet adoring,
worthy the Lamb.
[3]
Harps and songs for ever sounding
worthy the Lamb;
mighty grace o’er sin abounding,
worthy the Lamb.
By His blood He dearly bought us;
wandering from the fold He sought us,
and to glory safely brought us;
worthy the Lamb.
[4]
Sing with blest anticipation,
worthy the Lamb;
through the vale of tribulation,
worthy the Lamb.
Sweetest notes, all notes excelling,
on the theme for ever dwelling,
still untold, though ever telling,
worthy the Lamb.</Contents>

And opened the life-gate that all may go in.

Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father through Jesus the Son;
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done!

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood!
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,

And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son:
But purer and higher and greater will be
Our wonder, our worship, when Jesus we see!</Contents>

Glory to God in the highest,

Glory to God in the highest,

Afraid, we covered up our faces,
amazed at what our ears did hear.
Good news of joy for all the people -

to find it all was true;

life everlasting receiving.

Life! life! eternal life!

Life! life! abundant life!
Glory to Jesus for ever!

Burdened one, why will you longer bear
sorrows from which He releases?
Open your heart, and, rejoicing, share
life more abundant in Jesus!

Leaving the mountain, the streamlet 
grows,
flooding the vale with a river;
so, from the hill of the Cross, there flows
life more abundant for ever.

Oh, for a mighty revival!
Oh, for a sanctified fearless band,
ready to hail its arrival!</Contents>

Up Calvary’s mountain, one dreadful morn,
walked Christ my Saviour, weary and worn;
facing for sinners death on the cross,
that He might save them from endless loss.
[chorus]
Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer!
Seems now I see Him on Calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading
blind and unheeding, dying for me!
[2]
“Father forgive them!” thus did He pray,
e’en while His life-blood flowed fast away;
praying for sinners while in such woe -
no one but Jesus ever loved so.
[3]
O how I love Him, Saviour and Friend!
How can my praises ever find end!
Through years unnumbered on heaven’s shore,
my tongue shall praise Him for evermore.</Contents>

Visit us, Lord, with revival!
Stricken with coldness and death,
where is our hope of survival
save in Thy life-giving breath?
[chorus]
Lord, send us revival!
Let it begin now in me!
Gladly dethroning each rival,
yield I my heart unto Thee.
[2]
The world, in its proud exultation,
lust of the flesh and the eye,
bent on the soul's desecration,
God and His people defy.
[3]
Turning aside into byways,
letting their ardour grow cold,
many are leaving the highways
trod by our fathers of old.
[4]
Oh, for the breath of the Spirit!
Oh, for the might of His sword,
leading us on to inherit
all that in Jesus is stored!
[5]
Surely 'tis time for revival;
surely soon dawneth the day;
soon shall we hail its arrival,
chasing the shadows away!</Contents>

Waiting for angry words to sear my soul
Knowing I don't deserve another chance
Suddenly the kindest words
I've ever heard, come flooding from God's heart
[chorus]
It's your kindness that leads us 
To repentance O Lord
Knowing that You love us, no matter what we do
Make us want to love You too
It's your kindness that leads us 
To repentance O Lord
Knowing that You love us, no matter what we do
Make us want to love You too
[2]
No excuse no one to blame no way to hide
The eyes of God have found my failures
Found my pain, He understands my weaknesses 
and knows my shame but His heart never leaves me.
[bridge]
If you are for us, who can be against us?
You gave us everything, Even Your only Son</Contents>

Wash me, O Lamb of God,
wash me from sin!
By Thine atoning blood,
oh, make me clean!
Purge me from every stain,
let me Thine image gain,
in love and mercy reign
o'er all within.
[2]
Wash me, O Lamb of God,
wash me from sin!
I long to be like Thee,
all pure within.
Now let the crimson tide,
shed from Thy wounded side,
be to my heart applied,
and make me clean.
[3]
Wash me, O Lamb of God,
wash me from sin!
I will not, cannot, rest
till pure within.
All human skill is vain,
but Thou canst cleanse each stain
till not a spot remain,
made wholly clean.
[4]
Wash me, O Lamb of God,
wash me from sin!
By faith Thy cleansing blood
now makes me clean.
So near art Thou to me,
so sweet my rest in Thee,
oh, blessed purity,
saved, saved from sin!
[5]
Wash me, O Lamb of God,
wash me from sin!
Thou while I trust in Thee,
wilt keep me clean.
Each day to Thee I bring
heart, life, yea, everything;
saved, while to Thee I cling,
saved from all sin!</Contents>

We are his children,
the fruit of his suffering,
saved and redeemed by his blood;
called to be holy, a light to the nations:
clothed with his power,
filled with his love.
[chorus]
Go forth in his name,
proclaiming, 'Jesus reigns!'
Now is the time for the church to arise
and proclaim him
'Jesus, Saviour, Redeemer and Lord'.
(Repeat)

Countless the souls
that are stumbling in darkness;
why do we sleep in the light?
Jesus commands us to go make disciples,
this is our cause,
this is our fight.

Listen, the wind
of the Spirit is blowing,
the end of the age is so near;
powers in the earth and heavens are shaking,
Jesus our Lord
soon shall appear.</Contents>

We are marching on, with shield and banner bright;
We will work for God, and battle for the right;
We will praise His name, rejoicing in His might,
And we'll work till Jesus calls.
From the youthful ranks our army we prepare,
As we rally round our blessèd standard here;
And the Saviour's cross we early learn to bear,
While we work till Jesus calls.
[2]
We are marching on:  our Captain, ever near,
Will protect us still, His gentle voice we hear:
Let the foe advance, we'll never, never fear,
For we'll work till Jesus calls.
Then awake, awake, our happy, happy song;
We will shout for joy, and gladly march along;
In the Lord of hosts let ev'ry heart be strong,
While we work till Jesus calls.
[3]
We are marching on the strait and narrow way,
That will lead to life and everlasting day,
To the smiling fields, that never will decay:
But we'll work till Jesus calls.
We are marching on, and pressing t'wards the prize,
To a glorious crown beyond the glowing skies,
To the radiant fields where pleasure never dies,
And we'll work till Jesus calls.
[chorus]
Then awake, . .then awake, . . .
Happy song, . . . happy song, . . .
Shout for joy, . . . shout for joy, . . .
As we gladly march along.
We are marching onward singing as we go,
To the promised land where living waters flow
Come and join our ranks as pilgrims here below,
Come and work till Jesus calls.</Contents>

Oh, the children of the Lord have a

for the way is growing bright and

We are going to a palace that is built of gold;
where the King in all His splendour we shall soon behold.

There we’ll shout redeeming mercy in a glad new song;
there we’ll sing the praise of Jesus with the blood-washed throng. </Contents>

with our Captain to lead us we 
fear not the foe,
for His strength is sufficient to carry us through.

We shall win! we shall win! 
We shall win! we shall win!
We will trust! We will pray!
And battle for the Lord our King.

Though the night may be dark
and the fight may be long,
yet the tumult of warfare shall
change into song
when the strongholds of darkness 
and evil shall fall,
and our Lord shall be Conqueror 
and reign over all.
[3]
See the millions that stray from 
the way of the Lord,
caring nought for His wrath and 
defying His word,
casting scorn on our Saviour,
despising His blood!
Will you not, then, enlist in the battle for God?
[4]
Come and join in the fight!
There are foes you must meet;
there are rebels and scoffers to 
bring to His feet;
there is work for you all, and your strength is secure;
there's a crown for the victor, and victory is sure.</Contents>

For all our frailty, You have entrusted us
To shine Your goodness
And life throughout the nations.

But we will not be crushed,
Your hope will strengthen us.
And when the hard times squeeze so tight,
May they release more
Of the fragrance of Jesus.

Through our lives, by Your grace,
May we overflow with Jesus.

We never need be vanquished,
we never need give in,
though waging war with Satan,
and compassed round by sin.
Temptations will beset us,
allurements oft assail,
but in the name of Jesus
we shall, we must prevail.
[2]
God wills not that His people
by sin enthralled should be,
but that their lives, as ransomed,
be lives of victory;
and so at our disposal
He places all His power,
that we from its resources
may draw in danger’s hour.
[3]
Herein is hid the secret
of an all-glorious life
whereby we conquer Satan,
and rise above sin’s strife.
Abiding in the Saviour,
self prostrate in the dust,
we live to do His bidding
in glad perpetual trust.
[4]
We in ourselves are nothing,
a small and feeble host,
nor have we aught of prowess
wherein to make our boast.
Our stronghold is Christ Jesus,
His grace alone we plead,
His name our shield and banner,
Himself, just all we need.</Contents>

We plough the fields and scatter
The good seed on the land,
But it is fed and watered
By God's almighty hand;
He sends the snow in winter,
The warmth to swell the grain,
The breezes and the sunshine,
And soft refreshing rain.

All good gifts around us
Are sent from heaven above;
Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord,
For all His love.
[2]
He only is the Maker
Of all things near and far;
He paints the wayside flower,
He lights the evening star;
The winds and waves obey Him,
By Him the birds are fed;
Much more to us, His children,
He gives our daily bread.
[3]
We thank Thee, then, O Father,
For all things bright and good;
The seedtime and the harvest,
Our life, our health, our food.
No gifts have we to offer
For all Thy love imparts,
But that which Thou desirest,
Our humble, thankful hearts.</Contents>

We rest on Thee and in Thy name we go.

Our Prince of glory and our King of love.

And needing more each day Thy grace to know:
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;
We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;
We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.

We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!
Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise;
When passing through the gates of pearly splendour,
Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.

We sing the praise of Him who died,
of Him who died upon the cross;
the sinner’s hope let men deride,
for this we count the world but lost.
[2]
Inscribed upon the cross we see,
in shining letters, “God is love”;
He bears our sins upon the tree,
He brings us mercy from above.
[3]
The cross! it takes our guilt away,
it holds the fainting spirit up;
it cheers with hope the gloomy day
and sweetens every bitter cup.
[4]
It makes the coward spirit brave,
and nerves the feeble arm for fight;
it takes the terror from the grave,
and gilds the bed of death with light.
[5]
The balm of life, the cure of woe,
the measure and the pledge of love;
the sinner’s refuge here below,
the angels’ theme in heaven above.</Contents>

We're here for the harvest,
Get ready to reap,
The call is for action,
It's not time to sleep.
We're here for the harvest,
The yield will be great;
The fields are now ripened,
So don't hesitate.
[bridge]
There's need for more labourers,
For many, not few,
The challenge set before us
Is who? And we cry:
Lord of the harvest,
In this day of Your power,
Hear the anthem of voices: 'send me!'
[chorus]
Send me, send me,
Lord of the harvest, send me!
Send me, send me,
Lord of the harvest, send me!
[2]
The Spirit is upon us,
To cause the blind to see;
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord
To set the captive free.
The homeless and the needy
Can no longer be ignored,
And all oppressed will celebrate
The favour of the Lord.
There's need for more labourers...</Contents>

hath sent us His Son to save us,
and show us that God is love,

who the path of sorrow has trod,
that all of the world's great peoples,
might come to the truth of God,

What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit!
O what needless pain we bear!
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer.
[2]
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[3]
Are we weak and heavy-laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.</Contents>

What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping:
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste, to bring Him praise,
The babe, the Son of Mary.
[2]
Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The babe, the Son of Mary.
[3]
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The babe, the Son of Mary.</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
What kind of greatness can this be,
that chose to be made small?
Exchanging untold majesty
for a world so pitiful.
That God should come as one of us,
I'll never understand.
The more I hear the story told,
the more amazed I am.
[chorus]
O what else can I do
but kneel and worship you,
and come just as I am,
my whole life an offering.
[2]
The One in whom we live and move
in swaddling clothes lies bound.
The voice that cried, 'Let there be light',
asleep without a sound.
The One who strode among the stars,
and called each one by name,
lies helpless in a mother's arms
and must learn to walk again.
[3]
What greater love could he have shown
to shamed humanity,
yet human pride hates to believe
in such deep humility.
But nations now may see his grace
and know that he is near,
when his meek heart, his words, his works
are incarnate in us.</Contents>

What shall I give Thee, Master?
Thou who did'st die for me.
Shall I give less of what I possess,
or shall I give all to Thee?
[chorus]
Jesus, my Lord and Saviour,
Thou hast given all for me;
Thou did'st leave Thy home above
to die on Calvary.
What shall I give Thee, Master?
Thou hast given all for me;
Not just a part or half of my heart,
I will give all to Thee.
[2]
What shall I give Thee, Master?
Thou hast redeemed my soul;
my gift is small but it is my all
surrendered to Thy control.
[3]
What shall I give Thee, Master?
Giver of gifts divine!
I will not hold time, talents or gold
For everything shall be Thine.</Contents>

When all my labours and trials are o’er,
and I am safe on that beautiful shore,
just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
will through the ages be glory for me.
[chorus]
Oh, that will be glory for me,
glory for me, glory for me,
when by His grace I shall look on His face,
that will be glory, be glory for me.

When, by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in heaven a place,
just to be there, and to look on His face,

Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
joy like a river around me will flow,
yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,
will through the ages be glory for me.</Contents>

When all Your mercies, O my God,
my rising soul surveys,
transported with the view, I’m lost
in wonder, love, and praise.
[2]
Unnumbered comforts on my soul
Your tender care bestowed,
before my infant heart conceived
from whom those comforts flowed.
[3]
Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
my daily thanks employ,
nor is the least a cheerful heart
that tastes those gifts with joy.
[4]
Through every period of my life
Your goodness I’ll pursue
and, after death, in distant worlds,
the glorious theme renew.
[5]
Through all eternity to You
a joyful song I’ll raise;
for, oh, eternity’s too short
to utter all Your praise!</Contents>

When God of old the way of life
would teach to all His own,
He placed them safe beyond the reach
of death, by blood alone.
[chorus]
It is His word, God’s precious word,
it stands for ever true:
“When I the Lord shall see the blood,
I will pass over you.”
[2]
By Christ, the sinless Lamb of God,
the precious blood was shed
when He fulfilled God’s holy word,
and suffered in our stead.
[3]
O soul, for thee salvation thus
by God is freely given;
the blood of Christ atones for sin,
and makes us meet for heaven.
[4]
The wrath of God that was our due,
upon the Lamb was laid;
and by the shedding of His blood
the debt for us was paid.
[5]
How calm the judgement hour shall pass
to all who do obey
the word of God, and trust the blood,
and make that word their stay!</Contents>

When I saw the cleansing fountain
open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit’s wooing
when He said “Wilt thou be clean?”
[chorus]
I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
praise Him, praise the Lamb for sinners slain!
Give Him glory all ye people,
for His blood has washed away my 
stain.
[2]
Though the way seemed straight and narrow,
all I claimed was swept away;
my ambition, plans and wishes,
at my feet in ashes lay.
[3]
Then God’s fire upon the altar
of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him:
glory! glory! to His name.
[4]
Blessed be the name of Jesus,
I’m so glad He took me in;
He has pardoned my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin.</Contents>

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
[2]
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.
[3]
See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
[4]
Were the whole realm of Nature mine,
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all!</Contents>

When Israel out of bondage came,
a sea before them lay;
the Lord reached down His mighty hand
and rolled the sea away.
[chorus]
Then forward still, ‘tis Jehovah’s will,
though the billows dash and spray;
with a conquering tread we will push ahead,
He’ll roll the sea away.
[2]
Before me was a sea of sin,
so great I feared to pray;
my heart’s desire the Saviour read
and rolled the sea away.
[3]
When sorrows dark, like stormy waves
were dashing o’er my way,
again the Lord in mercy came
and rolled the sea away.
[4]
And when I reach the sea of death,
for needed grace I’ll pray;
I know the Lord will quickly come
and roll the sea away.</Contents>

When Jesus comes to reward His servants,
whether it be noon or night,
faithful to Him will He find us watching,
with our lamps all trimmed and bright?
[chorus]
Oh, can we say we are ready, brother?
Ready for the soul’s bright home?
Say, will He find you and me still watching,
waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?
[2]
If at the dawn of the early morning,
He shall call us one by one,
when to the Lord we restore our talents,
will He answer thee, “Well done!”?
[3]
Have we been true to the trust He left us?
Do we seek to do our best?
If, in our hearts, there is nought condemns us,
we shall have a glorious rest.
[4]
Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching
in His glory they shall share
if He should come at the dawn or midnight,
will He find us watching there?</Contents>

When morning gilds the skies
My heart awaking cries:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
Alike at work and prayer
To Jesus I repair:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
[2]
Does sadness fill my mind?
A solace here I find:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
When evil thoughts molest,
With this I shield my breast:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
[3]
To God, the Word, on high
The hosts of angels cry:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
Let mortals, too, upraise
Their voice in hymns of praise:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
[4]
Let earth's wide circle round
In joyful notes resound:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
Let air, and sea, and sky,
From depth to height, reply:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
[5]
Be this while life is mine
My canticle divine:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
Be this the eternal song,
Through all the ages long:
'May Jesus Christ be praised!'</Contents>

I shall know Him, I shall know Him 
as redeemed by His side I shall stand,
I shall know Him, I shall know Him
by the print of the nails in His hand.

Oh, the soul-thrilling rapture when I view His blessed face,
and the lustre of His kindly beaming eye;
how my full heart will praise Him for the mercy, love, and grace
that prepares me for a mansion in the sky.

Oh, the dear ones in glory, how they beckon me to come,
and our parting at the river I recall;
to the sweet vales of Eden they will sing my welcome home,
but I long to meet my Saviour first of all.
[4]
Through the gates to the city in a robe of spotless white,
He will lead me where no tears shall ever fall;
in the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight;
but I long to meet my Saviour first of all.</Contents>

My sin - not in part - but the whole
Is nailed to His cross; and I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live!
If Jordan above me shall roll.
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
You will whisper Your peace to my soul.

It is well, with my soul;
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

The sky, not the grave, is our goal!
O Trump of the angel! O voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope! Blessed rest of my soul.</Contents>

as men that dreamed were we.
Then filled with laughter was our mouth,
our tongue with melody.

They among the heathen said, The Lord
great things for them hath wrought.
The Lord hath done great things for us,
whence joy to us is brought.

As streams of water in the south,
our bondage, Lord, recall.
Who sow in tears, a reaping time
of joy enjoy they shall.

That man who, bearing precious seed,
in going forth doth mourn,
He doubtless, bringing back his sheaves,
rejoicing shall return.</Contents>

When each other's face we see;

Shall then be raised in power,
And the songs of the blood bought millions
Shall hail that blissful hour;

And night's dark shadows fly,
What a shouting on the shore
When we meet to part no more,

When the trumpet of the Lord shall
sound and time shall be no more,
and the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;
when the saved of earth shall gather over
on the other shore,
and the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.
[chorus]
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder, 
When the roll is called up yonder, 
When the roll is called up yonder,  
I’ll be there.
[2]
On that bright and cloudless morning
when the dead in Christ shall rise,
and the glory of His resurrection share;
when His chosen ones shall gather to 
their home beyond the skies,
and the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.
[3]
Let us labour for the Master from the
dawn till setting sun,
let us tell of all His wondrous love and care;
then when all of life is over, and our
work on earth is done,
and the roll is called up yonder, we’ll be there.</Contents>

When upon life's billows
You are tempest tossed
When you are discouraged
Thinking all is lost
Count your many blessings
Name them one by one
And it will surprise you
What the Lord has done
[chorus]
Count your blessings
Name them one by one
Count your blessings
See what God has done
Count your blessings
Name them one by one
Count your many blessings
See what God has done
[2]
Are you ever burdened
With a load of care
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear
Count your many blessings
Every doubt will fly
And you will be singing
As the days go by
[3]
When you look at others
With their lands and gold
Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold
Count your many blessings
Money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven
Nor your home on high
[4]
So, amid the conflict
Whether great or small
Do not be discouraged
God is over all
Count your many blessings
Angels will attend
Help and comfort give you
To your journey's end</Contents>

When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey!
[chorus]
Trust and obey!
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.
[2]
Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt nor a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey!
[3]
Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay:
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown nor a cross,
But is blessed if we trust and obey!
[4]
But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favour He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for those who will trust and obey.
[5]
Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go;
Never fear, only trust and obey!</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
When you feel weakest, dangers surround,
subtle temptations, troubles abound,
nothing seems hopeful, nothing seems glad,
all is despairing, even-time sad.
[chorus]
Keep on believing, Jesus is near,
keep on believing, there’s nothing to fear;
keep on believing, this is the way,
faith in the night, as well as the day.
[2]
If all were easy, if all were bright,
where would the cross be? Where would the fight?
But in the hardness, God gives to you
chances of proving that you are true.
[3]
God is your Wisdom, God is your Might,
God’s ever near you, guiding you right;
He understands you, knows all you need;
trusting in Him you’ll surely succeed.
[4]
Let us press on, then, never despair,
live above feeling, victory’s there;
Jesus can keep us so near to Him
that nevermore our faith shall grow dim.</Contents>

When you lift your hands up high
And you sing a song of praise to Me
It brings me great delight
Such a lovely sight
And yes it is true
Praise looks good on you
[2]
Morning night and noon
Your praise ascends to Heaven
Like the smell of sweet perfume
Filling every room
And yes it is true
Praise looks good on you
[3]
You bring your sacrifices
And you offer up your praise
You lift your voice with singing
But your heart seems far away
More than a sacrifice 
I am looking for your life
Holy and acceptable
And pleasing in My sight
[4]
So offer up your lives
Holy and acceptable
A willing sacrifice
Precious in My sight
But in all that you do
Remember all I want is you
[5]
So lift your hands up high
And worship Him before the altar
Consecrate your life
A willing sacrifice
But in all that you do
Remember all he wants is you
And yes it is true
Praise looks good on you</Contents>

O I delight in His command,
love to be led by His dear hand,
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, nor doubt nor fear,
happy with Christ, my Saviour near,
trusting some day that I shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary.</Contents>

Where might you be going this fine day my friend,
Off along an aimless road that soon must end,
Chasing and illusive dream that shines so fair,
But when found, it isn't there.

I can understand your weary sigh, my friend,
There, but the grace of God go I, my friend,
Come and let Him lead you to your journey's end,
Oh come along and walk with Him.
[3]
If without the grace of God your life should end,
And before the face of God you'd stand, my friend,
What would your illusive dream avail you then?
So come along and walk with Him.</Contents>

Where will you spend eternity?
This question comes to you and me.
Tell me, what shall your answer be,
where will you spend eternity?
Eternity! eternity!
Where will you spend eternity?

Many are choosing Christ today,
turning from all their sins away:
heaven shall their happy portion be,
where will you spend eternity?
Eternity! eternity!
Where will you spend eternity?
[3]
Leaving the straight and narrow way,
going the downward road today,
sad will their final ending be -
lost through a long eternity!
Eternity! eternity!
Lost through a long eternity!
[4]
Repent, believe, this very hour,
trust in the Saviour’s grace and power,
then will your joyous answer be,
saved through a long eternity!
Eternity! eternity!
Saved through  a long eternity!</Contents>

While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone around.
[2]
'Fear not' said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind;
'Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.
[3]
'To you in David's town this day
Is born of David's line
A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord,
And this shall be the sign.
[4]
'The heavenly babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands,
And in a manger laid.'
[5]
Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels, praising God, who thus
Addressed their joyful song:
[6]
'All glory be to God on high
And on the earth be peace;
Goodwill henceforth from heaven to men
Begin and never cease.'</Contents>

Who is on the Lord's side?
Who will serve the King?
Who will be His helpers
Other lives to bring?
Who will leave the world's side?
Who will face the foe?
Who is on the Lord's side?
Who for Him will go?
By Thy call of mercy,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
Saviour, we are Thine.
[2]
Jesus, Thou hast bought us
Not with gold or gem,
But with Thine own life-blood,
For Thy diadem.
With Thy blessing filling
Each who comes to Thee
Thou hast made us willing,
Thou hast made us free.
By Thy grand redemption,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
Saviour, we are Thine.
[3]
Fierce may be the conflict,
Strong may be the foe,
But the King's own army
None can overthrow;
Round His standard ranging
Victory is secure;
For His truth unchanging
Makes the triumph sure.
Joyfully enlisting,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
Saviour, we are Thine.
[4]
Chosen to be soldiers
In an alien land,
Chosen, called, and faithful,
For our Captain's band;
In the service royal
Let us not grow cold,
Let us be right loyal,
Noble, true, and bold.
Master, Thou wilt keep us,
By Thy grace divine,
Always on the Lord's side,
Saviour, always Thine.</Contents>

Who would true valour see,
let him come hither;
one here will constant be,
come wind, come weather;
there’s no discouragement
shall make him once relent
his first avowed intent
to be a pilgrim.
[2]
Who so beset him round
with dismal stories,
do but themselves confound;
His strength the more is.
No lion can him fright,
he’ll with a giant fight,
but he will have a right
to be a pilgrim.
[3]
Hobgoblin nor foul fiend
can daunt his spirit;
he knows he at the end
shall life inherit.
Then fancies flee away;
he’ll fear not what men say;
he’ll labour night and day
to be a pilgrim.</Contents>

“Whom shall I send?” the prophet heard
when he, enraptured, saw the Lord;
He rose and went, his spirit stirred,
“Whom shall I send today?”
[chorus]
“Whom shall I send?” O hear the cry!
“Whom shall I send?” From sky to sky!
“Whom shall I send to bring men nigh?
Whom shall I send today?”
[2]
Do the bright youth no longer care?
Do they not see the treasures rare?
Where are they then, O where, O where?
“Whom shall I send today?”
[3]
Following far they hear no call!
Sleeping so sound while millions fall!
Do they not care at all, at all?
“Whom shall I send today?”
[4]
“Whom shall I send?” O who will go?
Who then will preach with a voice of woe?
Who will  be sped by love's strong bow?
“May I send you today?”
[ending]
Lord of the harvest, here am I,
I can no more resist Thy cry,
cost what it may: to live or die.
Send me, dear Lord, today.</Contents>

    <Title1>Will your anchor hold in the storms of life</Title1>

    <Contents>[1]
Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,
when the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
will your anchor shift, or firm remain?
[chorus]
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
grounded firm and deep in the Saviour’s love.
[2]
It is safely moored, ‘twill the storm withstand,
for ‘tis well secured by the Saviour’s hand;
and the cables passed from His heart to mine
can defy the blast, through strength divine.
[3]
It will firmly hold in the straits of  fear,
when the breakers have told that the reef is near;
though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,
not an angry wave shall our bark o’erflow.
[4]
It will surely hold in the floods of death,
when the waters cold chill our latest breath;
on the rising tide it can never fail,
while our hopes abide within the veil.
[5]
When our eyes behold through the gathering night
the city of gold, our harbour bright,
we shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore,
with the storms all past for evermore.</Contents>

With all my heart,
I will put my trust in you.
With all my heart,
I will put my trust in you.
I will lean on you,
depend on you,
I will look to the one I love
with all my heart.
[1]
When in despair,
and no one else cares,
storms all around,
no friends can be found;
you're always there,
you're always there for me.
[2]
Nothing compares
to your faithfulness,
no greater love
in earth or above:
so I'll declare,
my heart is safe in your arms.

    <Contents>[1]
With broken heart and contrite sigh,
a trembling sinner, Lord, I cry;
Thy pardoning grace is rich and free:
O God, be merciful to me!
[2]
I smite upon my troubled breast,
with deep and conscious guilt oppressed;
Christ and His Cross my only plea:
O God, be merciful to me!
[3]
Far off I stand with tearful eyes,
nor dare uplift them to the skies;
but Thou dost all my anguish see:
O God, be merciful to me!
[4]
Nor alms, nor deeds that I have done,
can for a single sin atone:
to Calvary alone I flee;
O God, be merciful to me!
[5]
And when, redeemed from sin and hell,
with all the ransomed throng I dwell,
my raptured song shall ever be:
God has been merciful to me!

With harps and with viols there stands a great throng
in the presence of Jesus, and sings this new song:
[chorus]
Unto Him Who hath loved us and washed us from sin,
unto Him be the glory for ever! Amen.
[2]
All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight;
now arrayed in pure garments, in praise they unite.
[3]
He maketh the rebel a priest and a king,
He hath bought us and taught us this new song to sing.
[4]
How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been,
if He never had loved us till cleansed from our sin.
[5]
Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring,
so that others, believing, this new song shall sing.</Contents>

Within the veil: Be this, beloved thy portion
within the secret of thy Lord to dwell;
beholding Him, until thy face His glory,
thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell.

Within the veil, for only as thou gazest
upon the matchless beauty of His face,
canst thou become a living revelation
of His great heart of love, His untold grace.
[3]
Within the veil, His fragrance poured upon thee,
without the veil, that fragrance shed abroad;
Within the veil, His hand shall tune the music
which sounds on earth the praises of thy Lord.
[4]
Within the veil, thy spirit deeply anchored,
Thou walkest calm above a world of strife;
Within the veil, thy soul with Him united,
shall live on earth His resurrection life.</Contents>

Wonderful birth, to a manger He came,
made in the likeness of man, to proclaim
God’s boundless love for a world sick with sin,
pleading with sinners to let Him come in.
[chorus]
Wonderful name He bears,
wonderful crown He wears,
wonderful blessings His triumphs afford;
wonderful Calvary,
wonderful grace for me,
wonderful love of my wonderful Lord!
[2]
Wonderful life, full of service so free,
friend to the poor and the needy was He;
unfailing goodness on all He bestowed,
undying faith in the vilest He showed.
[3]
Wonderful death, for it meant not defeat,
Calvary made His great mission complete,
wrought our redemption, and when He arose,
banished for ever the last of our foes.
[4]
Wonderful hope, He is coming again,
coming as King o’er the nations to reign;
glorious promise, His word cannot fail,
His righteous kingdom at last must prevail!</Contents>

    <Contents>[1]
Wonderful love that rescued me,
sunk deep in sin,
guilty and vile as I could be,
no hope within;
when every ray of light had fled,
O glorious day, 
raising my soul from out the dead,
love found a way.
[chorus]
Love found a way to redeem my soul,
love found a way that could make me whole;
love sent my Lord to the cross of shame,
love found a way, O praise His holy name!
[2]
Love brought my Saviour here to die
on Calvary,
for such a sinful wretch as I,
how can it be?
Love bridged the gulf ‘twixt me and heaven,
taught me to pray;
I am redeemed, set free, forgiven,
love found a way.
[3]
Love opened wide the gates of light
to heaven’s domain.
where in eternal power and might
Jesus shall reign;
love lifted me from depths of woe
to endless day,
there was no help in earth below,
love found a way.</Contents>

Wondrous Love of Jesus! spread the news around,
pardon freely offered, what a joyful sound!
Jesus, loving Saviour, died to set me free;
oh, that blessed “Whosoever,” that means me.
[chorus]
Pardon freely offered all who will believe;
whosoever cometh Jesus will receive;
Jesus, loving Saviour, died to set us free:
hallelujah! “Whosoever” that means
me.
[2]
Whosoever cometh may the promise claim,
precious blood of Jesus cleanseth every stain.
The Son of God has loved me, wonder can it be?
“Whosoever,” saith the Saviour that means me.
[3]
Do not trust your feeling, trust His word alone.
Prayers can never save you, tears cannot atone.
“Finished!” cried the Saviour, nothing now to do.
Come, believe this “Whosoever” - that means you.</Contents>

Between the living and the dead
Give us a heart of compassion
For a world without vision

Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide!

Would you live daily His praises to sing?</Contents>

Yes, God is good - in earth and sky,
from ocean-depths and spreading wood,
ten thousand voices seem to cry:
'God made us all, and God is good.'
[2]
The sun that keeps his trackless way
and downward pours his golden flood,
night's sparkling hosts, all seem to say
in accents clear that God is good.
[3]
The merry birds prolong the strain,
their song with ev'ry spring renewed;
and balmy air and falling rain,
each softly whispers: 'God is good.'
[4]
We hear it in the rushing breeze;
the hills that have for ages stood,
the echoing sky and roaring seas,
all swell the chorus: 'God is good.'
[5]
For all thy gifts we bless thee, Lord,
but chiefly for our heav'nly food,
thy pard'ning grace, thy quick'ning word,
these prompt our song, that God is good.</Contents>

Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin,
each victory will help you some other to win;
fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue,
look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.
[chorus]
Ask the Saviour to help you,
comfort, strengthen, and keep you;
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.
[2]
Shun evil companions, bad language disdain,
God’s name hold in reverence, nor take it in vain;
be thoughtful and earnest, kind-hearted and true,
look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.
[3]
To him that o’ercometh God giveth a crown,
through faith we shall conquer, though often cast down;
He who is our Saviour our strength will renew,
look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.</Contents>

    <SongNumber>100</SongNumber>
    <Contents>[1]
You ask me why I see no charm nor glory
in this world's pleasures or its wealth and fame?
And why I love that Galilean story
of One who died upon a cross of shame?
It is because my soul hath known her sinning,
the grief and darkness of that cry “undone,”
and at that Cross has found a new beginning,
life through the death of that dear Dying One.
[2]
You ask me why I find no rest nor gladness
in paths where selfish ease would while my hours?
And why I toil where hearts in bitter sadness
lie crushed beneath sin's fierce o'erwhelming powers?
It is because I know Life's thread is slender,
but one short hour, one little stretch of road.
Then yearns my heart with love divinely tender,
to seek the lost and bring them home to God.
[3]
You ask me why what gifts I have, what graces
are poured an offering at His holy feet,
and why I brave the cold contemptuous faces
of those who love this world and find it sweet?
It is because I see a distant morning
when stand God's sons around His jasper throne;
I see bright crowns those holy brows adorning,
and I, too, long to hear my Lord's “Well done.”</Contents>

And we'll cry "holy, holy, holy"

And all that I now do is for You.

Pouring over me,
Everlasting love and mercy,
Over me in a flood of power.
Pouring over me, abounding grace so free,
Over me Your unending love.

I've never had a friend like You;
All that You've promised You will do.
I'm drinking from the fountain
That will never run dry,
I'm living in the joy of a heart that's purified.
I'm walking now with You,
And all I have is Yours,
Take my life.</Contents>

For You took my empty life,
And filled it with every good thing.

Now my heart is full of thanksgiving,
For all of the riches You give.</Contents>

Your arms stretched out and open wide
To rescue me so I can be a child of God
From nail pierced hands to
Thorn pierced brow
Your blood flows down to me somehow
It cleanses me so I can be a child of God

Praise to the lamb that was slain
Praise to the Father 
who gave his son away
The proof of love, the price of grace 
You traded all to take my place
You died for me so I can be

Oh wash me in His precious blood
My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God

They laughed and scorned Him as He died
The humble King they named a fraud
And sacrificed the Lamb of God

I was so lost, I should have died
But You have brought me to Your side
To be led by Your staff and rod
And to be called the Lamb of God</Contents>
